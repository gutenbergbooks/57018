<p>“D’ye see it, pard?”</p>

<p>“See what, Rough?”</p>

<p>“The light from over the Range.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, Rough. It’s not daybreak yet. Yer sick, an’ yer head
bothers ye.”</p>

<p>“Pard, yer off. I’ve been sick, but I’m well again. It’s not dark like
it was. The light’s a-comin’—comin’ like the boyhood days that crep’
inter the winders of the old home.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve been dreamin’, Rough. The fever hain’t all outen yer head yet.”</p>

<p>“Dreamin’? ’Twa’n’t all dreams. It’s the light comin’, pard. I see
’em all plain. Thar’s the ole man lookin’ white an’ awful, just as he
looked the mornin’ he drove me from home; and that woman behind him,
stretchin’ out her arms arter me, is the best mother in the world.
Don’t you see ’em, pard?”</p>

<p>“Yer flighty, Rough. It’s all dark, ’cepting a pine-knot flickerin’ in
the ashes.”</p>

<p>“No—the light’s a-comin’ brighter and brighter. Look! It’s beamin’
over the Range bright and gentle, like the smile that used to be over
me when my head lay in my mother’s lap, long ago.”</p>

<p>“Hyar’s a little brandy, Rough. Thar; I seen it though my eyes are
dim—somehow—hyar, Rough.”</p>

<p>“Never, pard. That stuff spiled the best years of my life—it sha’n’t
spile my dreams of ’em. Oh, sich dreams, pard! They take me to the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
home again. I see the white house ’mong the trees. I smell the breath
of the apple-blossoms, and hear the birds singin’ and the bees
hummin’, and the old plough-songs echoin’ over the leetle valley. I
see the river windin’ through the willers an’ sycamores, an’ the dear
ole hills all around, p’intin’ up to heaven like the spires of big
meetin’-houses. Thar’s the ole rock we called the tea-table. I climb up
on it, an’ play a happy boy agin. Oh, if I’d only staid thar, pard!”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Rough; ye thaw me all out, talkin’ that. It makes me womanish.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, pard: we’ve kep’ our hearts froze so long, we want it allus
winter. But the summer comes back with all the light from over the
Range. How bright it is, pard! Look! How it floods the cabin till the
knots an’ cobwebs are plainer than day.”</p>

<p>“Suthin’s wrong, Rough. It’s all dark, ’cept only that pine-knot in the
chimbly.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s all right, pard. The light’s come over the Range. I kin see
better’n I ever could. Kin see the moister in yer eyes, pard, an’ see
the crooked path I’ve come, runnin’ clean back to my mother’s knee. I
wasn’t allus called Rough. Somebody used to kiss me, an’ call me her
boy: nobody’ll ever know I’ve kep’ it till the end.”</p>

<p>“I hev wanted to ax ye, mate, why ye never had any name but jist Rough?”</p>

<p>“Pard—it’s gettin’ dark—my name? I’ve never heard it since I left
home. I buried it thar in the little churchyard, whar mother’s
waitin’ for the boy that never come back. I can’t tell it, pard. In
my kit you’ll find a package done up. Thar’s two picters in it of two
faces that’s been hoverin’ over me since I took down. You’ll find my
name thar, pard—thar with hers—an’ mother’s.”</p>

<p>“Hers? Will I ever see her, Rough?”</p>

<p>“Not till you see her by the light that comes over the Range to us all.
Pard, it’s gettin’ dark—dark and close—darker than it ever seemed to
me afore”—</p>

<p>“Rough, what’s the matter? Speak to me, mate. Can’t I do nuthin’ fer
ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes—pard. Can’t ye—say—suthin’?”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean, Rough? I’ll say any thing to please ye.”</p>

<p>“Say—a—pra’r, pard.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>“A pra’r! Rough, d’ye mean it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a pra’r, pard. It’s the—last thing Rough’ll ever—ax of ye.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to do, Rough. I don’t know a pra’r.”</p>

<p>“Think back, pard. Didn’t yer mother—teach ye—suthin’? One that
begins—‘Our Father’—an’ then—somehow—says—‘forgive us’—”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Rough, ye break me all up.”</p>

<p>“The light’s a-fadin’—on the golden hills—an’ the night is
comin’—out of the canyuns—pard. Be quick—ye’ll try, pard. Say
suthin’—fer Rough”—</p>

<p>“I—Rough—Our Father, forgive us. Don’t be hard on Rough. We’re a
tough lot. We’ve forgot ye, but we hain’t all bad. ’Cause we hain’t
forgot the old home. Forgive us—be easy on Rough. Thy will be done”—</p>

<p>“It’s comin’ agin—pard. The light’s—comin’—over the Range”—</p>

<p>“Have mercy on—us, an’—an’—an’—settle with us ’cordin’ to—to the
surroundin’s of our lives. Thy—Thy kingdom come”—</p>

<p>“Go on, pard. It’s comin’.”</p>

<p>“Now—I lay me down to sleep.”</p>

<p>“That’s—good—mother said that.”</p>

<p>“Hallowed be Thy name—pray—the Lord his soul to keep.”</p>

<p>“That’s good—pard. It’s all glory—comin’ over—the Range—mother’s
face—her—face”—</p>

<p>“Thine is the glory, we ask—for Jesus’ sake—Amen.”</p>

<p>“Pard”—</p>

<p>“What, Rough? I’m all unstrung. I”—</p>

<p>“Fare”—</p>

<p>“Rough! Yer worse! What, dead?”</p>

<p>Yes, the wanderings were over. Ended with a prayer, rough and sincere,
like the heart that had ceased to throb; a prayer and a few real tears,
even in that lone cabin in the cañon; truer than many a death scene
knows, although a nation does honor to the dying; a prayer that pleased
Him better than many a prayer of the schools and creeds. A rough but
gentle hand closed the eyes. The first rays of the morning sun broke
through a crevice in the little cabin, and hung like his mother’s smile
over the couch of the sleeping boy. Only one mourner watched with Rough
as he waited for the new name which will be given to us all, when that
light comes to the world from over the Range.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Street-car driver, “Ninety-three!”</span>
<span class="i2">Very weary and worn was he,</span>
<span class="i0">As he dragged himself to his little home;</span>
<span class="i2">Long, long hours from year to year,</span>
<span class="i2">Never a day for rest, no cheer,</span>
<span class="i0">In the woods or meadows in joy to roam.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">All day through in tiresome round,</span>
<span class="i2">Wages scanty, and prospects bound</span>
<span class="i0">In a treadmill life from sun to sun,</span>
<span class="i2">Facing the winter’s cold and sleet,</span>
<span class="i2">Facing the summer’s burning heat,</span>
<span class="i0">With little to hope and little won.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The clothing was poor of “Ninety-three,”</span>
<span class="i2">And poor as well for the family;</span>
<span class="i0">But the wife was patient with gentle grace.</span>
<span class="i2">“I’ve watched all day by the baby’s bed;</span>
<span class="i2">I think he is going, John,” she said,</span>
<span class="i0">With an anxious look on her pallid face.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He gazed with pride on his baby boy.</span>
<span class="i2">“He is handsome, wife!” and a look of joy</span>
<span class="i0">Just for a moment dried the tears.</span>
<span class="i2">“How does he look in the glad daylight?</span>
<span class="i2">I have never seen him, except at night;”</span>
<span class="i0">And he sighed as he thought of the weary years.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Labor the blessing of life should be,</span>
<span class="i2">But it seemed like a curse to “Ninety-three,”</span>
<span class="i0">For twice too long were the toiling hours;</span>
<span class="i2">Never the time to improve the mind,</span>
<span class="i2">Or joy in his little ones to find:</span>
<span class="i0">Grasping and thoughtless are human powers.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">All night long did the driver stay</span>
<span class="i2">By the beautiful child, then stole away,</span>
<span class="i0">Hoping, still hoping that God would save;</span>
<span class="i2">But when the sun in the heavens rose high,</span>

<p>You sent for me, and I’ve come: if you have nothing to say, I go back
again. How is it, brothers? The doubt seems on all your faces, and your
young warriors grasp their fire-weapons, as if they waited the onset
of the foe. You were like a small thing upon the great waters; you had
no earth to rest upon; you left the smoke of your father’s wig-wam far
in the distance, when the lord of the soil took you as little children
to his home; our hearths were warm, and the Indian was the white man’s
friend. Your great Book tells you to give good gifts. The Indian needs
no book: the Great Spirit has written with his finger on his heart.
Wisconego here? let me see his eye! Art thou not he whom I snatched
from the war-club of the Mohegan, when the lips of the foe thirsted for
thy blood, and their warriors had sung thy death-song? Say unto these
people that they have bought thy tongue, and that thy coward heart has
uttered a lie. Slave of the whites, go! (<i>stabs him</i>) follow Sassawan!
White man, beware! the wrath of the wronged Indian shall fall on you
like a mighty cataract that dashes the uprooted oak down its mighty
chasm; the dread war-cry shall start you from dreams at night, and the
red hatchet gleam in the blaze of your burning dwellings. Tremble, from
the east to the west, from the north to the south, till the lands you
have stolen groan beneath your feet! (<i>Throws hatchet on stage.</i>) Thus
do I smite your nation, and defy your power!</p>

<span class="i0">On the helpless Flemish village</span>
<span class="i2">Cruel Alva swooped and fell;</span>

<span class="i0">In the town-house, tall and handsome,</span>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="PICKWICK" id="PICKWICK"></a>MR. PICKWICK’S ROMANTIC ADVENTURE
WITH A<br /> MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL-PAPERS.</h3></div>

<p>“Dear me, it’s time to go to bed. It will never do, sitting here. I
shall be pale to-morrow, Mr. Pickwick!”</p>

<p>At the bare notion of such a calamity, Mr. Peter Magnus rang the bell
for the chambermaid; and the striped bag, the red bag, the leather
hat-box, and the brown-paper parcel, having been conveyed to his
bedroom, he retired in company with a japanned candlestick to one side
of the house, while Mr. Pickwick, and another japanned candlestick,
were conducted through a multitude of tortuous windings to another.</p>

<p>“This is your room, sir,” said the chambermaid.</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Mr. Pickwick, looking round him. It was a
tolerably large double-bedded room, with a fire; upon the whole, a more
comfortable-looking apartment than Mr. Pickwick’s short experience of
the accommodations of the Great White Horse had led him to expect.</p>

<p>“Nobody sleeps in the other bed, of course,” said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Tell my servant to bring me up some hot water at half-past
eight in the morning, and that I shall not want him any more to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” And bidding Mr. Pickwick good-night, the chambermaid
retired, and left him alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire, and fell
into a train of rambling meditations. First he thought of his friends,
and wondered when they would join him; then his mind reverted to Mrs.
Martha Bardell; and from that lady it wandered, by a natural process,
to the dingy counting-house of Dodson and Fogg. From Dodson and
Fogg’s it flew off at a tangent, to the very centre of the history of
the queer client; and then it came back to the Great White Horse at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Ipswich, with sufficient clearness to convince Mr. Pickwick that he was
falling asleep; so he roused himself, and began to undress, when he
recollected he had left his watch on the table down-stairs.</p>

<p>Now, this watch was a special favorite with Mr. Pickwick, having been
carried about, beneath the shadow of his waistcoat, for a greater
number of years than we feel called upon to state at present. The
possibility of going to sleep unless it were ticking gently beneath his
pillow, or in his watch-pocket over his head, had never entered Mr.
Pickwick’s brain. So as it was pretty late now, and he was unwilling
to ring his bell at that hour of the night, he slipped on his coat,
of which he had just divested himself, and, taking the japanned
candlestick in his hand, walked quietly down-stairs.</p>

<p>The more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down, the more stairs there seemed
to be to descend; and again and again, when Mr. Pickwick got into some
narrow passage, and began to congratulate himself on having gained the
ground-floor, did another flight of stairs appear before his astonished
eyes. At last he reached a stone hall, which he remembered to have seen
when he entered the house. Passage after passage did he explore; room
after room did he peep into; at length, just as he was on the point of
giving up the search in despair, he opened the door of the identical
room in which he had spent the evening, and beheld his missing property
on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph, and proceeded to retrace his
steps to his bed-chamber. If his progress downwards had been attended
with difficulties and uncertainty, his journey back was infinitely more
perplexing. Rows of doors garnished with boots of every shape, make,
and size, branched off in every possible direction. A dozen times did
he softly turn the handle of some bedroom door which resembled his own,
when a gruff cry from within, of “Who the devil’s that?” or “What do
you want here?” caused him to steal away, on tiptoe, with a marvellous
celerity. He was reduced to the verge of despair, when an open door
attracted his attention. He peeped in—right at last! There were the
two beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered, and the fire still
burning. His candle, not a long one when he first received it, had
flickered away in the draughts of air through which he had passed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sunk into the socket just as he closed the door after him. “No matter,”
said Mr. Pickwick, “I can undress myself just as well, by the light of
the fire.”</p>

<p>The bedsteads stood, one on each side of the door; and on the inner
side of each was a little path, terminating in a rush-bottomed chair,
just wide enough to admit of a person’s getting into or out of bed
on that side, if he or she thought proper. Having carefully drawn
the curtains of his bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat down on the
rush-bottomed chair, and leisurely divested himself of his shoes and
gaiters. He then took off and folded up his coat, waistcoat, and
neck-cloth, and, slowly tying on his tasselled nightcap, secured it
firmly on his head, by tying beneath his chin the strings which he had
always attached to that article of dress. It was at this moment that
the absurdity of his recent bewilderment struck upon his mind; and
throwing himself back in the rush-bottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick laughed
to himself so heartily, that it would have been quite delightful to any
man of well-constituted mind to have watched the smiles which expanded
his amiable features as they shone forth from beneath the nightcap.</p>

<p>“It is the best idea,” said Mr. Pickwick to himself, smiling till he
almost cracked the nightcap strings,—“it is the best idea, my losing
myself in this place, and wandering about those staircases, that I ever
heard of. Droll, droll, very droll.” Here Mr. Pickwick smiled again,
a broader smile than before, and was about to continue the process
of undressing, in the very best possible humor, when he was suddenly
stopped by a most unexpected interruption; to wit, the entrance into
the room of some person with a candle, who, after locking the door,
advanced to the dressing-table, and set down the light upon it.</p>

<p>The smile that played on Mr. Pickwick’s features was instantaneously
lost in a look of the most unbounded and wonder-stricken surprise. The
person, whoever it was, had come in so suddenly and with so little
noise, that Mr. Pickwick had no time to call out, or oppose their
entrance. Who could it be? A robber! Some evil-minded person who had
seen him come up-stairs with a handsome watch in his hand, perhaps.
What was he to do?</p>

<p>The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse of his
mysterious visitor, with the least danger of being seen himself, was by
creeping on to the bed, and peeping out from between the curtains on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the opposite side. To this manœuvre he accordingly resorted. Keeping
the curtains carefully closed with his hand, so that nothing more
of him could be seen than his face and nightcap, and putting on his
spectacles, he mustered up courage, and looked out.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay. Standing before
the dressing-glass was a middle-aged lady in yellow curl-papers,
busily engaged in brushing what ladies call their “back hair.” However
the unconscious middle-aged lady came into that room, it was quite
clear that she contemplated remaining there for the night; for she
had brought a rushlight and shade with her, which, with praiseworthy
precaution against fire, she had stationed in a basin on the floor,
where it was glimmering away like a gigantic light-house in a
particularly small piece of water.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul,” thought Mr. Pickwick, “what a dreadful thing!”</p>

<p>“Hem!” said the lady; and in went Mr. Pickwick’s head with
automaton-like rapidity.</p>

<p>“I never met any thing so awful as this,” thought poor Mr. Pickwick,
the cold perspiration starting in drops upon his nightcap. “Never. This
is fearful.”</p>

<p>It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see what was
going forward. So out went Mr. Pickwick’s head again. The prospect was
worse than before. The middle-aged lady had finished arranging her
hair, and carefully enveloped it in a muslin nightcap with a small
plaited border, and was gazing pensively on the fire.</p>

<p>“This matter is growing alarming,” reasoned Mr. Pickwick with himself.
“I can’t allow things to go in this way. By the self-possession of that
lady, it’s clear to me that I must have come into the wrong room. If I
call out, she’ll alarm the house; but if I remain here, the consequence
will be still more frightful!”</p>

<p>Mr. Pickwick, it is quite necessary to say, was one of the most modest
and delicate-minded of mortals. The very idea of exhibiting his
nightcap to a lady overpowered him; but he had tied those confounded
strings in a knot, and, do what he would, he couldn’t get it off. The
disclosure must be made. There was only one other way of doing it. He
shrunk behind the curtains, and called out very loudly,—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ha—hum.”</p>

<p>That the lady started at this unexpected sound, was evident by her
falling up against the rushlight shade; that she persuaded herself it
must have been the effect of imagination, was equally clear, for when
Mr. Pickwick, under the impression that she had fainted away, stone
dead from fright, ventured to peep out again, she was gazing pensively
on the fire as before.</p>

<p>“Most extraordinary female this,” thought Mr. Pickwick, popping in
again. “Ha—hum.”</p>

<p>These last sounds, so like those in which, as legends inform us, the
ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of expressing his opinion
that it was time to lay the cloth, were too distinctly audible to be
again mistaken for the workings of fancy.</p>

<p>“Gracious Heaven!” said the middle-aged lady, “what’s that?”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s—only a gentleman, ma’am,” said Mr. Pickwick from behind
the curtains.</p>

<p>“A gentleman!” said the lady with a terrific scream.</p>

<p>“It’s all over,” thought Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>“A strange man!” shrieked the lady. Another instant, and the house
would be alarmed. Her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door.</p>

<p>“Ma’am”—said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting out his head, in the extremity of
his desperation, “ma’am.”</p>

<p>Now, although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by any definite object
in putting out his head, it was instantaneously productive of a good
effect. The lady, as we have already stated, was near the door. She
must pass it to reach the staircase; and she would most undoubtedly
have done so, by this time, had not the sudden apparition of Mr.
Pickwick’s nightcap driven her back, into the remotest corner of the
apartment, where she stood staring wildly at Mr. Pickwick, while Mr.
Pickwick in his turn stared wildly at her.</p>

<p>“Wretch,” said the lady, covering her eyes with her hands, “what do you
want here?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, ma’am,—nothing whatever, ma’am,” said Mr. Pickwick earnestly.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” said the lady looking up.</p>

<p>“Nothing, ma’am, upon my honor,” said Mr. Pickwick, nodding his head
so energetically, that the tassel of his nightcap danced again. “I am
almost ready to sink, ma’am, beneath the confusion of addressing a lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
in my nightcap (here the lady hastily snatched off hers), but I can’t
get it off, ma’am (here Mr. Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug in
proof of the statement). It is evident to me, ma’am, now, that I have
mistaken this bedroom for my own. I had not been here five minutes,
ma’am, when you suddenly entered it.”</p>

<p>“If this improbable story be really true, sir,” said the lady, sobbing
violently, “you will leave it instantly.”</p>

<p>“I will, ma’am, with the greatest pleasure,” replied Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>“Instantly, sir,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“Certainly, ma’am,” interposed Mr. Pickwick, very quickly. “Certainly,
ma’am. I—I—am very sorry, ma’am,” said Mr. Pickwick, making his
appearance at the bottom of the bed, “to have been the innocent
occasion of this alarm and emotion; deeply sorry, ma’am.”</p>

<p>The lady pointed to the door. One excellent quality of Mr. Pickwick’s
character was beautifully displayed at this moment, under the most
trying circumstances. Although he had hastily put on his hat over his
nightcap, after the manner of the old patrol; although he carried his
shoes and gaiters in his hand, and his coat and waistcoat over his arm,
nothing could subdue his native politeness.</p>

<p>“I am exceedingly sorry, ma’am,” said Mr. Pickwick, bowing very low.</p>

<p>“If you are, sir, you will at once leave the room,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“Immediately, ma’am; this instant, ma’am,” said Mr. Pickwick, opening
the door, and dropping both his shoes with a loud crash in so doing.</p>

<p>“I trust, ma’am,” resumed Mr. Pickwick, gathering up his shoes, and
turning round to bow again, “I trust, ma’am, that my unblemished
character, and the devoted respect I entertain for your sex, will plead
as some slight excuse for this”—But before Mr. Pickwick could conclude
the sentence, the lady had thrust him into the passage, and locked and
bolted the door behind him.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="DASSAS" id="DASSAS"></a>THE DEATH OF D’ASSAS.</h3></div>

<p class="blockquot">[In the autumn of 1760, Louis XV. sent an army
into Germany. They took up a strong position at Klostercamp, intending
to advance on Rheinberg. The young Chevalier D’Assas was sent out
by Auvergne to reconnoitre. He met a party advancing to surprise
the French camp. Their bayonets pricked his breast, and the leader
whispered, “Make the least noise, and you are a dead man.” D’Assas
paused a moment, then cried out as loud as he could, “Here, Auvergne!
here are the enemy!” He was immediately cut down, but his death had
saved the French army.—<i>History of France.</i>]</p>

<span class="i0">No braver knight holds charger’s reign, or wields the glittering lance.</span>
<span class="i0">Than proud and lordly D’Assas, bold chevalier of France.</span>

<span class="i0">The sound of war strikes on the air from far beyond the Rhine,</span>

<span class="i0">Plant the white flag of Ivry on valley and on town.</span>

<span class="i0">On Klostercamp the morning sun is glancing brightly down.</span>
<span class="i0">Auvergne has ranged his forces within the ancient town.</span>

<span class="i0">Shall yield her towers to Auvergne, shall ope her gates to him.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His warriors stand about him, a bold and gallant band,</span>
<span class="i0">No general e’er had truer men to follow his command.</span>
<span class="i0">He seeks the best and bravest; on D’Assas falls his glance,—</span>
<span class="i0">On brave and lordly D’Assas, bold chevalier of France.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Advance, my lord,” cried Auvergne; D’Assas is at his side.</span>
<span class="i0">“Of all the knights who form my train, who ’neath my banner ride,</span>
<span class="i0">None hold the place of trust the king our sovereign gives to thee,—</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou accept a fearful charge that death or fame shall be?</span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou, O D’Assas! ride to-night close to the foemen’s line,</span>
<span class="i0">And see what strength he may oppose to these proud hosts of mine?”</span>
<span class="i0">Then D’Assas bows his stately head. “Thy will shall soon be done.</span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">No martial music cleaves the air, no sound of beaten drum.</span>
<span class="i0">Like spectre forms they seem to glide before his wondering eyes;</span>
<span class="i0">Well hath he done, the wary foe, to plan this wild surprise.</span>
<span class="i0">Back D’Assas turns; but ah! too late,—a lance is laid in rest:</span>
<span class="i0">The knight can feel its glittering point against his corselet prest.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A Frenchman! Hist!” A heavy hand has seized his bridle-rein.</span>
<span class="i0">“Hold close thy lips, my gallant spy; one word, and thou art slain.</span>

<span class="i0">What brought thee here? Dost thou not know this is the Fatherland?</span>
<span class="i0">How dar’st thou stain our righteous earth with thy foul Popish band?</span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst guard thy life, then utter not one sound above thy breath;</span>
<span class="i0">A whisper, and thy dainty limbs shall make a meal for Death.</span>
<span class="i0">Within thy heart these blades shall find the black blood of thy race,</span>
<span class="i0">And none shall ever know or dream of thy last resting-place.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Calm as a statue D’Assas stands. His heart he lifts on high.</span>
<span class="i0">“The God of battles! help me now, and teach me how to die.</span>
<span class="i0">A weeping maid will mourn my fate, a sovereign holds me dear;</span>
<span class="i0">Be to them ever more than I who perish sadly here.”</span>
<span class="i0">No word has passed his pallid lips, no sound his voice has made.</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas but the utterance of his heart, this prayer the soldier prayed.</span>
<span class="i0">But then? ah, then! No voice on earth e’er rang more loud and clear:</span>
<span class="i0">“Auvergne!” he cried, “Auvergne, Auvergne! Behold! the foe is here!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The forest echoes with the shout. Appalled his captors stand.</span>
<span class="i0">The courage of that dauntless heart has stayed each murderous hand.</span>
<span class="i0">A moment’s pause,—then who can tell how quick their bayonets’ thrust</span>
<span class="i0">Reached D’Assas’ heart, and laid him there, a helpless heap of dust!</span>
<span class="i0">The bravest chevalier of France, the pride of Louis’ train,—</span>
<span class="i0">His blood bedews that alien earth, a flood of crimson rain.</span>
<span class="i0">But Auvergne—Auvergne hears the cry; his troops come dashing on:</span>
<span class="i0">Ere D’Assas’ spirit leaves its clay, the victory has been won.</span>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="LABOR" id="LABOR"></a>THE LABOR QUESTION.</h3></div>

<p>Let me tell you why I am interested in the labor question. Not simply
because of the long hours of labor; not simply because of a specific
oppression of a class. I sympathize with the sufferers there: I am
ready to fight on their side. But I look out upon Christendom, with its
three hundred millions of people; and I see, that, out of this number
of people, one hundred millions never had enough to eat. Physiologists
tell us that this body of ours, unless it is properly fed, properly
developed, fed with rich blood and carefully nourished, does no justice
to the brain. You cannot make a bright or a good man in a starved body;
and so this one-third of the inhabitants of Christendom, who have never
had food enough, can never be what they should be. Now, I say that the
social civilization which condemns every third man in it to be below
the average in the nourishment God prepared for him, did not come from
above: it came from below; and, the sooner it goes down, the better.
Come on this side of the ocean. You will find forty millions of people,
and I suppose they are in the highest state of civilization; and yet it
is not too much to say, that, out of that forty millions, ten millions
at least, who get up in the morning and go to bed at night, spend all
the day in the mere effort to get bread enough to live. They have not
elasticity enough, mind or body, left, to do any thing in the way of
intellectual or moral progress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe in the temperance movement. I am a temperance man of nearly
forty years’ standing; and I think it one of the grandest things in the
world, because it holds the basis of self-control. Intemperance is the
cause of poverty, I know; but there is another side to that: poverty is
the cause of intemperance. Crowd a man with fourteen hours’ work a day,
and you crowd him down to a mere animal life. You have eclipsed his
aspirations, dulled his tastes, stunted his intellect, and made him a
mere tool, to work fourteen hours, and catch a thought in the interval;
and, while a man in a hundred will rise to be a genius, ninety-nine
will cower down under the circumstances.</p>

<p>That is why I say, lift a man, give him life, let him work eight hours
a day, give him the school, develop his taste for music, give him a
garden, give him beautiful things to see, and good books to read, and
you will starve out those lower appetites. Give a man a chance to earn
a good living, and you may save his life.</p>

<p>If you want power in this country; if you want to make yourselves felt;
if you do not want your children to wait long years before they have
the bread on the table they ought to have, the leisure in their lives
they ought to have, the opportunities in life they ought to have; if
you don’t want to wait yourselves,—write on your banner, so that every
political trimmer can read it, so that every politician, no matter how
short-sighted he may be, can read it, “We never forget! If you launch
the arrow of sarcasm at labor, we never forget; if there is a division
in Congress, and you throw your vote in the wrong scale, we never
forget. You may go down on your knees, and say, ‘I am sorry I did the
act;’ and we will say, ‘It will avail you in heaven, but on this side
of the grave never.’” So that a man, in taking up the labor question,
will know he is dealing with a hair-trigger pistol, and will say, “I am
to be true to justice and to man: otherwise I am a dead duck.”</p>

<span class="i4">He went with her to church one day; the folks hilarious grew,</span>
<span class="i2">to see him walk demurely into Deacon Allen’s pew.</span>
<span class="i4">The worthy deacon quickly let his angry passions rise,</span>
<span class="i2">and gave it an unchristian kick between the sad brown eyes.</span>
<span class="i4">This landed rammy in the aisle; the deacon followed fast,</span>

<span class="i4">For Mr. Sheep walked slowly back, about a rod ’tis said,</span>
<span class="i2">and ere the deacon could retreat he stood him on his head.</span>
<span class="i4">The congregation then arose, and went for that ’ere sheep:</span>
<span class="i2">several well-directed butts just piled them in a heap.</span>
<span class="i4">Then rushed they straightway for the door, with curses long and loud;</span>
<span class="i2">while rammy struck the hindmost man, and shoved him through the crowd.</span>
<span class="i4">The minister had often heard that kindness would subdue</span>
<span class="i2">the fiercest beast. “Aha!” he said, “I’ll try that game on you.”</span>
<span class="i4">And so he kindly, gently, called, “Come, rammy, rammy, ram;</span>
<span class="i2">to see the folks abuse you so, I grieved and sorry am.”</span>
<span class="i4">With kind and gentle words he came from that tall pulpit down,</span>
<span class="i2">saying, “Rammy, rammy, ram—best sheepy in the town.”</span>
<span class="i4">The ram quite dropped its humble air, and rose from off his feet;</span>
<span class="i2">and when the parson landed, he was behind the hindmost seat.</span>

<span class="i0">Rajah Balpoora, Prince of Jullinder,</span>
<span class="i2">Reigned in the land where the Five Rivers ran;</span>
<span class="i0">A lordly tyrant, with none to hinder</span>
<span class="i2">His wildest pleasure or maddest plan.</span>
<span class="i0">His hall was beauty, his throne was splendor,</span>
<span class="i2">His meat was dainties of every zone;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever a joy that wealth can render,</span>
<span class="i2">His whimsical fancy left unknown.</span>
<span class="i0">For afar, in sight of his palace windows,</span>
<span class="i2">His realm was gardens on every hand;</span>
<span class="i0">And the feet of a hundred thousand Hindoos</span>
<span class="i2">Came and went at his least command.</span>
<span class="i0">But one thing, worthy his pride to show it,</span>
<span class="i2">Among his treasures, eclipsed them all;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas the marvel of sage and the praise of poet,—</span>
<span class="i2">The wonderful clock in his palace hall.</span>
<span class="i0">Brain and fingers of matchless cunning</span>
<span class="i2">Patiently planned the strange machine,—</span>
<span class="i0">Framed, and balanced, and set it running,</span>
<span class="i2">With a living heart in its wheels unseen.</span>
<span class="i0">Behind the dial, the iron pallet</span>
<span class="i2">Counted the seconds; and just below</span>
<span class="i0">Hung a silver gong, and a brazen mallet</span>
<span class="i2">For every hour had a brazen blow;</span>
<span class="i0">And near, like windrowed leaves in the weather,</span>
<span class="i2">Or battle-wrecks at a charnel door,</span>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On his cool back porch sat Deacon Brown, the richest and fattest man</span>
<span class="i6">in town.</span>
<span class="i0">Before, behind, to left and right, showed meadows dotted with gold</span>
<span class="i6">and white,</span>
<span class="i0">And grazing there in the pastures green, fifteen fine Jerseys as</span>
<span class="i6">ever seen;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The regular herd-book stock were they, and how much butter they made</span>
<span class="i6">each day,</span>
<span class="i4">I hardly would dare attempt to say.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No greater joy had Deacon Brown, than to sit on the porch, as the</span>
<span class="i6">sun went down,</span>
<span class="i0">And view his acres so broad and fine, and feast his eyes on his</span>
<span class="i6">Jersey kine;</span>
<span class="i0">But now his face wore a look much vexed, and he drummed his knees in</span>
<span class="i6">a way perplexed,</span>
<span class="i0">As, sitting snug in his tilted chair, he gazed at the goodly show</span>
<span class="i6">and fair,</span>
<span class="i4">Of bovine beauties grazing there.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well might the Deacon muse and frown, and vaguely scratch his</span>
<span class="i6">smooth, bald crown;</span>
<span class="i0">For a Jersey heifer, his pride and boast, the one of all that he</span>
<span class="i6">valued most,</span>
<span class="i0">Had taken it into her head that she not like her meeker sisters</span>
<span class="i6">would be,</span>
<span class="i0">And so, at sight of the milking-pail, would lower her horns and</span>
<span class="i6">thrash her tail,</span>
<span class="i4">And kick till her kicking power would fail.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All sorts of cures had the Deacon tried; but, alas for a good old</span>
<span class="i6">churchman’s pride!</span>
<span class="i0">“The finest heifer in this ’ere town” would never a drop of milk</span>
<span class="i6">give down</span>
<span class="i0">For one whole day, though coaxed and fed with the “cream of the</span>
<span class="i6">place,” so the Deacon said;</span>
<span class="i0">And when thrice she’d knocked the good man over, as if barnyard mud</span>
<span class="i6">were a field of clover,</span>
<span class="i0">He vowed in his wrath, as a deacon may, that he’d sell the creetur</span>
<span class="i6">the very next day,</span>
<span class="i4">To the village butcher, and risk his pay.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet now, as he sat and thought it o’er, it seemed that his cross was</span>
<span class="i6">indeed most sore;</span>
<span class="i0">He could not do it: ’twould break his heart, from his goodly heifer</span>
<span class="i6">this way to part!</span>
<span class="i0">Just then strolled toward him his elder son, who never a bit of work</span>
<span class="i6">had done,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But fished in the brook through the livelong day, instead of helping</span>
<span class="i6">get in the hay,</span>
<span class="i4">Or “lift” at the work in any way.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the Deacon frowned a frown most stern: “’Twas time that a lazy</span>
<span class="i6">youth should learn</span>
<span class="i0">To earn his salt; ’twas different when he was his age,—the men</span>
<span class="i5"><i>was</i> men,</span>
<span class="i0">Not idle care-naughts; and going to school made something besides a</span>
<span class="i6">college fool.”</span>
<span class="i0">Then, growing milder, “Wal, ’bout Peachblow—I reckoned a cure you’d</span>
<span class="i6">hap to know,</span>
<span class="i4">In that heathen gabble you chatter so.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the idle scapegrace, with twinkling eye, “I’ve heard of a cure</span>
<span class="i6">which you might try.”</span>
<span class="i0">Then some Latin words he gravely said. “If on to her back a weight</span>
<span class="i6">is laid,</span>
<span class="i0">She’ll give milk straightway, and quiet be.” Said the doubting</span>
<span class="i6">Deacon, “I’ll try and see.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out in the stable Peachblow stood, calm chewing her cud as a heifer</span>
<span class="i6">should.</span>
<span class="i0">Spoke the Deacon: “William, you’re young and spry; you can climb on</span>
<span class="i6">her back, now, quicker’n I.</span>
<span class="i0">You’ll do for the weight. I’ll fetch the stool, and milk the</span>
<span class="i6">critter: you just keep cool.”</span>
<span class="i0">But scarce had the hopeful gained his seat, when out flew the placid</span>
<span class="i6">Peachblow’s feet.</span>
<span class="i0">And milker and milking-stool upset, in a way too hurried for</span>
<span class="i6">etiquette.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the Deacon roared in his wrath, “Get down! I’ll try</span>
<span class="i6">myself,—that’ll bring her roun’.”</span>
<span class="i0">And, puffing and grumbling, with Will to boost, he found himself on</span>
<span class="i6">his novel roost.</span>
<span class="i0">But, alas! with what little certainty can we plume our minds on</span>
<span class="i6">things to be!</span>
<span class="i0">For, just as the Deacon, with voice elate, cried, “Go to milkin’; you</span>
<span class="i6">needn’t wait!”</span>
<span class="i4">The stanchion was loosed by some luckless Fate,—</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And wildly out through the open door dashed—as she never had dashed</span>
<span class="i6">before—</span>
<span class="i0">The frightened heifer, with snorts and bounds, and her load of a</span>
<span class="i6">hundred and ninety pounds.</span>
<span class="i0">The roaring scapegrace behind was left; while, like a creature of</span>
<span class="i6">sense bereft,</span>
<span class="i0">Young Peachblow flew with her frantic feet, a-bellowing down the</span>
<span class="i6">village street,—</span>
<span class="i4">To the district school-boys what a treat!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Deacon’s neckerchief flapped in the wind; his hat blew off, and</span>
<span class="i6">was left behind;</span>
<span class="i0">His eyes bulged out, his face grew white, his fringe of hair stood</span>
<span class="i6">up with fright;</span>
<span class="i0">The children scampered with laugh and hoot, the dogs all started in</span>
<span class="i6">mad pursuit;</span>
<span class="i0">The geese they squawked, and the chickens flew; the wives ran,</span>
<span class="i6">startled by such ado;</span>
<span class="i4">Out ran the husbands, to cry, “Halloo!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the good old parson, with face aghast, flew to the gate as the</span>
<span class="i6">deacon passed.</span>
<span class="i0">What a dreadful scandal throughout the town might rise from this</span>
<span class="i6">frolic of Deacon Brown!</span>
<span class="i0">Was he drunk, or crazy, that thus he’d ride? And, loud as he could,</span>
<span class="i6">the parson cried,</span>
<span class="i0">“Stop, stop, Brother Brown! Oh! where will you go?” and back from</span>
<span class="i6">the dust came these words of woe:</span>
<span class="i4">“The Lord and this cow, sir, only know!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she stopped at last, this steed so gay; she stopped quite short</span>
<span class="i6">in a sudden way,</span>
<span class="i0">Struck out her heels with a graceful poise, and the hundred and</span>
<span class="i6">ninety avoirdupois</span>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="SILVER_BELL" id="SILVER_BELL"></a>THE SILVER BELL.</h3></div>

<p>Once upon a time, an old legend says, in a splendid palace a king lay
dying. By his couch knelt his only son, with tears streaming down his
face; but only a few quiet words were now and then spoken.</p>

<p>“Father, you remember the beautiful silver bell hanging above the
palace,—the one you had made years ago, of such pure tone that the
maker stood entranced at its first note, but which has ever since been
still? Why did you hang it there, if it was never to be rung?”</p>

<p>“My son, when I was young, and full of life and hope, I commanded the
best workmen in my kingdom to make a perfect silver bell, and hang
it above my palace, that its sweet tones might tell my people that
their king was perfectly happy. But alas! though I expected so much
happiness, the moment has never come when I could say, ‘Ring the bell!’
and now I am dying, and it is still silent. My son, if your happiness
is ever complete,—if you are without an anxious thought or wish,—then
let the silver bell proclaim the fact to all your people.”</p>

<p>“But, father, if you were not lying here I should be happy now, and the
bell should ring every day of my life.”</p>

<p>The old king smiled sadly, and, turning his face away, soon slept to
wake no more. With much mourning he was laid away in the royal tomb,
and his son became king in his stead. He could not ring the bell then,
for he grieved for his father; but he thought that after a time he
should be happy again.</p>

<p>And the days went by, and the young king married a beautiful girl; and
he said, “Now, for the first time, the bell shall ring.”</p>

<p>But as he and his bride came from the church, a woman, young in years,
but haggard with grief, carrying a little child in her arms, threw
herself at his feet, begging him to spare the life of her husband, who
was condemned to die for plotting against the king. “He saw so much
splendor and wealth, and we were starving. Oh, on this day, pardon him!”</p>

<p>The king raised the wretched woman, and gave her her husband’s freedom;
but a swift shadow had come over his happiness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>And the months went by, and a beautiful babe was born to be king after
him. And he said, “Now at length the bell shall ring.” But just then
came word that a terrible sickness raged among the children of the
kingdom, that many mothers were mourners, and their hearts could not be
comforted.</p>

<p>And the years rolled by, and the king was a great and good man, kind
to his people, sharing their sorrows, and, so far as he could, lifting
their burdens. The days were so full of thought and work, that he did
not think of the bell, or of his own happiness.</p>

<p>At last he too lay dying; and when he knew that the end was drawing
near, he asked to be carried to the room of state, and to be placed
once more upon his throne, that his people might come to see him.
And they crowded in, rich and poor, high and low, kissing his hands,
his feet, and even the hem of his garment. And when he saw them so
grief-stricken and tearful, a great light came into his dim eyes; and,
lifting his trembling arms, in a clear voice he cried, “Ring the silver
bell! ring the bell! My people love me; at last I am happy!” And as,
for the first time, the bell pealed forth its ringing notes, his spirit
took its flight to the unseen land.</p>

<p>Old Moses, who sells eggs and chickens on the streets of Austin for a
living, is as honest an old negro as ever lived; but he has got the
habit of chatting familiarly with his customers, hence he frequently
makes mistakes in counting out the eggs they buy. He carries his wares
around in a small cart drawn by a diminutive donkey. He stopped in
front of the residence of Mrs. Samuel Burton. The old lady herself came
out to the gate to make the purchases.</p>

<p>“Have you got any eggs this morning, Uncle Moses?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I has. Jess got in ten dozen from de kentry.”</p>

<p>“Are they fresh?”</p>

<p>“Fresh? yas, indeed! I guantees ’em, an’—an’—de hen guantees ’em.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll take nine dozen. You can just count them into this basket.”</p>

<p>“All right, mum;” he counts, “one, two, free, foah, five, six, seben,
eight, nine, ten.—You can rely on dem bein’ fresh. How’s your son

already.—Eighteen (counting), nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,
twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-foah, twenty-five.—And how’s your gal
comin’ on? She was most growed up de last time I seed her.”</p>

<p>“She is married, and living in Dallas.”</p>

<p>“Fifty-free! I jess dun gwinter bleeve hit; fifty-free, fifty-foah,

<p>Old Mose went on his way rejoicing. A few days afterward Mrs. Barton

them day before yesterday, and now about half of them are gone. I stood

dozen.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="YACHT-RACE" id="YACHT-RACE"></a>A CENTRE-BOARD YACHT-RACE.</h3></div>

<p>“Mr. Bingham,” said the “city editor” of the “Royal Bugle” one morning,
“the ‘sporting editor’ is away, and it will be necessary for you to go
down to Swampscott to report a race between centre-board yachts.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know any thing about yachts or yacht-racing.”</p>

<p>“It’s not necessary to know. See the head man, and get the time. That’s
about all we want.”</p>

<p>About nine o’clock that night, a forlorn, tramp-like looking object
entered the office of the “Royal Bugle,” with the crown of his white
Derby knocked in, the rim bent, and his clothing generally hanging
limp,—the suit, once light in color, now spotted and stained. As he
advanced into a better light, he was recognized as the “fire reporter;”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and a chorus of exclamations followed: “Where’s the fire?” or, “Did
they put the hose on you?” as the unfortunate man sank, apparently
exhausted, into a chair.</p>

<p>“It’s not a fire,” he growled. “It’s a yacht-race.”</p>

<p>“What did they do to you?”</p>

<p>“Do to me? They did every thing except drown me, and almost did that.
This morning,” continued the dejected man, “our local editor sent me
down to Swampscott to report a centre-board yacht race. He said if
I could get aboard one of the racing yachts I’d have a delightful
time,—a regular marine picnic. Well, I had it,—yes, indeedy; enough
picnic of the kind to last the rest of life. I knew the yachtsmen
were spruce sort of fellows, dressed well; and therefore I put on
my best suit,—new rig just from the tailor’s,—and hurried away to
the Swampscott sands. I found the fleet of centre-boards tied up to
a wharf. In making inquiries of a captain, I hinted that it would be
agreeable to me to be a passenger on his yacht.</p>

<p>“He smiled serenely, the villain! and said he’d be delighted to have
me come aboard. Oh, the baseness of the man! Very soon the race began;
and when fairly under way, and I had settled into a comfortable seat to
enjoy it, the captain shouted, ‘All down, down below the’—the—what do
you call the rail that runs around the top of the boat?—the gun—the gun”—</p>

<p>“Whale!”</p>

<p>“Yes, the gunwhale. Well, he said we must keep our heads below that, in
order to offer less resistance to the wind. Therefore three of us were
obliged to lie on our stomachs on the bottom of the boat. If we wanted
to see the race, we looked through the skipper’s windows”—</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>“Why, the skipper’s holes, as they call them,—a nautical term for
windows, I sup”—</p>

<p>“Scupper-holes!”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, that sounds more like. The man who lay next to me kept
himself busy and contented by eating peanuts. But that was nothing,
comparatively. Soon we ran into a big wave. If the skipper’d had any
sense of honor or regard for his passengers, he would have turned one
side to let the wave pass; but he didn’t. He ran slap into it, and the
crest of it came on board, caromed on the skipper himself, who stood at
the helm, and then circulated among the shifting ballast. Owing to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
peanut-eater, the skipper-win—no, the scupper-holes—were clogged; and
the remnant of the wave, unable to escape from the boat, was absorbed
by our clothing, and my new suit began to take additional shades and wrinkles.</p>

<p>“Suddenly that graceless captain shouted something about ‘hard lee,’
and then the boat lurched and tipped the other way; and we, lying
prostrate, were ordered to creep carefully around the centre-board,
and lie on the other side. That was the most fiendish! If my memory be
good, we crawled back and forth around that centre-board a dozen times.
If we were going to win the race, why didn’t we keep straight on, and
not turn to the right or left every twenty minutes?</p>

<p>“But the climax came. The skipper decided to turn the boat around
when she was going at full speed, and to drive her in the opposite
direction. Well, when she turned around”—</p>

<p>“Jibed, you mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that sounds like it. When she jibed she turned over on her side,
and a part of the shifting ballast, another man, and myself, went
overboard; but we caught on the gunwhale, and, the boat coming down
flat again, we crawled in. When I, forlorn and dripping, asked if they
turned around usually in that way, they laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, about an hour afterward, after mopping the bottom of the boat
some more with our clothing, we reached the landing from which we had
departed.”</p>

<p>“<i>We did not win.</i></p>

<p>“In response to an inquiry in regard to our defeat, the captain,
ungrateful, said that he had too much ballast. Wasn’t that the
refinement of cruelty? Wasn’t it a dastardly insult? After I’d spoiled
a suit of clothes by exerting myself in his behalf in climbing around
that centre-board, and nearly lost my life,—of course, if I had not
caught the side of the boat when I went overboard, they would not stop
to take me in, because the race was very important, and the prize was
a three-cornered blue flag,—after all that, I say, ’twas rascally to
hint that I’d lost the race for him.</p>

<p>“When the boat was a safe distance from the shore, after leaving me on
the wharf, the captain cried, ‘Had a good time?’ Gentlemen, to reply
would have been an indignity to myself; but I indulged in a little
pantomime to show the pirate skipper that, if I’d had him there, I’d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
injure the wharf with him. ‘Why didn’t I come home sooner?’ Because I
waited the coming of night to shield me from the gaze of the village
constable, who has a personal enmity against tramps,—makes them saw
wood. I knew that my tattered and begrimed appearance would bring me
under the ban of the law. I walked home by way of the beach.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="CANVASSER" id="CANVASSER"></a>THE BOOK CANVASSER.</h3></div>

<p>He came into my office with a portfolio under his arm. Placing it
upon the table, removing a ruined hat, and wiping his nose upon a
ragged handkerchief that had been so long out of the wash that it was
positively gloomy, he said,—</p>

<p>“Mr.———, I’m canvassing for the National Portrait Gallery; very
valuable work; comes in numbers, fifty cents apiece; contains pictures
of all the great American heroes from the earliest times down to the
present day. Everybody subscribing for it, and I want to see if I can’t
take your name.</p>

<p>“Now, just cast your eyes over that,” he said, opening his book and
pointing to an engraving. “That’s—lemme see—yes, that’s Columbus,
perhaps you’ve heard sumfin’ about him. The publisher was telling me
to-day, before I started out, that he discovered—No; was it Columbus
that dis—Oh, yes, Columbus, he discovered America—was the first man
here. He came over in a ship, the publisher said, and it took fire,
and he staid on deck because his father told him to, if I remember
right, and when the old thing busted to pieces he was killed. Handsome
picture, ain’t it? Taken from a photograph, all of ’em are; done
especially for this work. His clothes are kinder odd, but they say
that’s the way they dressed in them days.</p>

<p>“Look at this one. Now, isn’t that splendid? That’s William Penn, one
of the early settlers. I was reading t’other day about him. When he
first arrived, he got a lot of Indians up a tree, and, when they shook
some apples down, he set one on top of his son’s head, and shot an
arrow plump through it and never grazed him. They say it struck them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Indians cold; he was such a terrific shooter. Fine countenance, hasn’t
he? Face shaved clean; he didn’t wear a mustache, I believe, but he
seems to have let himself out on hair. Now, my view is, that every man
ought to have a picture of that patriarch so’s to see how the fust
settlers looked, and what kind of weskets they used to wear. See his
legs too. Trousers a little short, maybe, as if he was going to wade in
a creek, but he’s all there. Got some kind of a paper in his hand, I
see. Subscription-list, I reckon. Now, how does that strike you?</p>

<p>“There’s something nice. That, I think, is—is—that—a—a—yes, to
be sure, Washington,—you recollect him, of course. Some people call
him Father of his Country; George—Washington. Had no middle name, I
believe. He lived about two hundred years ago, and he was a fighter. I
heard the publisher telling a man about him crossing the Delaware River
up yer at Trenton; and seems to me, if I recollect right, I’ve read
about it myself. He was courting some girl on the Jersey side, and he
used to swim over at nights to see her, when the old man was asleep.
The girl’s family were down on him, I reckon. He looks like a man to do
that, don’t he? He’s got it in his eye. If it’d been me, I’d gone over
on a bridge; but he probably wanted to show off afore her,—some men
are so reckless, you know. Now, if you’ll conclude to take this, I’ll
get the publisher to write out some more stories, and bring ’em round
to you, so’s you can study up on him. I know he did ever so many other
things; but I’ve forgot ’em, my memory’s so awful poor.</p>

<p>“Less see! Who have we next? Ah, Franklin! Benjamin Franklin! He was
one of the old original pioneers, I think. I disremember exactly what
he is celebrated for, but I think it was a—flying a—oh! yes, flying a
kite, that’s it. The publisher mentioned it. He was out one day flying
a kite, you know, like boys do nowadays, and while she was a-flickering
up in the sky, and he was giving her more string, an apple fell off a
tree, and hit him on the head; then he discovered the attraction of
gravitation, I think they call it. Smart, wasn’t it? Now, if you or
me’d ’a’ been hit, it’d just ’a’ made us mad, like as not, and set us
a-ravin’. But men are so different! One man’s meat’s another man’s
pison. See what a double chin he’s got. No beard on him, either, though
a goatee would have been becoming to such a round face. He hasn’t got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
on a sword, and I reckon he was no soldier; fit some when he was a boy,
maybe, or went out with the home-guard, but not a regular warrior. I
ain’t one myself, and I think all the better of him for it.</p>

<p>“Ah, here we are! Look at that. Smith and Pocahontas! John Smith!
Isn’t that gorgeous? See how she kneels over him, and sticks out her
hands while he lays on the ground, and that big fellow with a club
tries to hammer him up! Talk about woman’s love! There it is for you!
Modocs, I believe. Anyway, some Indians out West there, somewheres;
and the publisher tells me that Captain Shackanasty, or whatever his
name is there, was going to bang old Smith over the head with a log
of wood, and this here girl she was sweet on Smith, it appears, and
she broke loose, and jumped forward, and says to the man with a stick,
‘Why don’t you let John alone? Me and him are going to marry, and if
you kill him I’ll never speak to you as long as I live,’ or words
like them; and so the man he give it up, and both of them hunted up a
preacher, and were married, and lived happy ever afterward. Beautiful
story, isn’t it? A good wife she made him, too, I’ll bet, if she was a
little copper-colored. And don’t she look just lovely in that picture?
But Smith appears kinder sick, evidently thinks his goose is cooked;
and I don’t wonder, with that Modoc swooping down on him with such a
discouraging club.</p>

<p>“And now we come to—to—ah—to—Putnam—General Putnam: he fought in
the war, too; and one day a lot of ’em caught him when he was off his
guard, and they tied him flat on his back on a horse, and then licked
the horse like the very mischief. And what does that horse do but go
pitching down about four hundred stone steps in front of the house,
with General Putnam lying there nearly skeered to death! Leastways the
publisher said somehow that way, and I once read about it myself. But
he came out safe, and I reckon sold the horse, and made a pretty good
thing of it. What surprises me is, he didn’t break his neck; but maybe
it was a mule, for they’re pretty sure-footed, you know. Surprising
what some of these men have gone through, ain’t it?</p>

<p>“Turn over a couple of leaves. That’s General Jackson. My father shook
hands with him once. He was a fighter, I know. He fit down in New
Orleans. Broke up the rebel legislature, and then, when the Ku Kluxes
got after him, he fought ’em behind cotton breastworks, and licked ’em
till they couldn’t stand. They say he was terrific when he got real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
mad,—hit straight from the shoulder, and fetched his man every time.
Andrew, his fust name was; and look how his hair stands up.</p>

<p>“And then, here’s John Adams, and Daniel Boone, and two or three
pirates, and a whole lot more pictures, so you see it’s cheap as dirt.
Lemme have your name, won’t you?”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="THE_WAVE" id="THE_WAVE"></a>THE COMING WAVE.</h3></div>

<p>Dipper Bay was a little inlet, almost land-locked, in which the water
was deep enough to float his sloop at this time of tide, and its high
rocky shores would afford him a perfect protection from the fury of
any squall, or even hurricane. But Leopold felt that his chances of
reaching this secure haven were but small, for the breeze was very light.</p>

<p>The sloop “Rosabel” was but a short distance from the shore when the
wind entirely subsided, and the long rollers were as smooth as glass.
The lightning glared with fearful intensity, and the thunder boomed
like the convulsions of an earthquake. By this time Rosabel [for whom
the sloop had been named], who had before enjoyed the sublimity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the coming storm, now began to realize its terrors, and to watch the
handsome boatman with the deepest anxiety. The sails flapped idly in
the motionless air, and Dipper Bay was still half a mile distant.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, Miss Hamilton,” said Leopold. “If the squall will
keep off only a few moments, we shall be in a safe place.”</p>

<p>The skipper evidently “meant business;” and, shipping the long oars, he
worked with a zeal which seemed to promise happy results, and Rosabel
began to feel a little re-assured. But the sloop was too large, and too
broad on the beam, to be easily rowed, and her progress was necessarily
very slow.</p>

<p>“Can’t I help you, Leopold?” asked the maiden, when she saw what a
tremendous effort the boatman was making.</p>

<p>“You may take the tiller, and steer for Dip Point, if you please,”
replied Leopold, knowing that his beautiful passenger would be better
satisfied if she could feel that she was doing something.</p>

<p>Leopold plied his oars with all the vigor of a manly frame, intent upon
reaching the little bay, where the high rocks would shelter his craft
from the fury of the storm. Then a breeze of wind came, and he resumed
his place at the tiller. He had almost reached the haven when he saw
coming down over the waters a most terrific squall. Before he could
haul down his mainsail, the tempest struck the “Rosabel.” He placed
his fair charge in the bottom of the boat, which the savage wind was
driving towards the dangerous rocks. Before he could do any thing to
secure the sail, the main-sheet parted at the boom. He cast off the
halliards, but the sail was jammed and would not come down.</p>

<p>The “Rosabel” was almost upon the rocks. Seizing an oar, Leopold,
satisfied that he could do nothing to save the boat, worked her away
from the rocks, so that she would strike upon the narrow beach he had
just left. The fierce squall was hurling her with mad speed upon the
shore. By the most tremendous exertion, and at the imminent peril of
his life, he succeeded in guiding her to the beach, upon which she
struck with prodigious force, crushing in her keel and timbers beneath
the shock. Without a word of explanation, he grasped the fair Rosabel
in his arms, and leaped into the angry surges, which were driven high
upon the rocks above him. The tide had risen so that there was hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
room under the cliff for him to stand; but he bore her to this only
partial refuge from the fury of the storm.</p>

<p>The tempest increased in violence, and the huge billows rolled in with
impetuous fury upon him. Grasping his fair burden in his arms, with
Rosabel clinging to him in mortal terror, he paused a moment to look at
the angry sea. There was a narrow shelf of rock near him, against which
the waves beat with terrible violence. If he could only get beyond this
shelf, which projected out from the cliffs, he could easily reach the
Hole in the Wall, where Harvey Barth had saved himself in just such a
storm. He had born Rosabel some distance along the beach, both drenched
by the lashing spray, and his strength was nearly exhausted. The projecting
shelf was before him, forbidding for the moment his further progress.</p>

<p>Placing his left foot on a rock, his fair but heavy burden on his knee,
clasping her waist with his left hand, while his right was fastened
for support in a crevice of the cliff, he paused for an instant to
recover his breath and watch for a favorable chance to escape from his
perilous position. Rosabel, in her terror, had thrown her arms around
his neck, clinging to him with all her might. When he paused, she felt,
reposing on his powerful muscles, that she was safe—she confessed it
afterwards; though, in that terrible sea and near those cruel rocks,
the strength of the strongest man was but weakness. Leopold waited.
If the sea would only recede for an instant, it would give him the
opportunity to reach the broader beach beyond the shelf, over which he
could pass to the Hole in the Wall. It was a moment of hope, mingled
with a mighty fear.</p>

<p>A huge billow, larger than any he had yet seen, was rolling in upon
him, crested and reeking with foam, and might dash him and his feeble
charge, mangled and torn, upon the jagged rocks. Still panting from the
violence of his exertion, he braced his nerves and his stout frame to
meet the terrible shock.</p>

<p>With every muscle strained to the utmost tension, he waited the coming
wave. In this attitude, with the helpless maiden clinging to him for
life, with the wreck of his fine yacht near, he was a noble subject for
an inspired artist.</p>

<p>The coming wave, buried him and the fair maiden in its cold embrace.
It broke, and shattered itself in torrents of milky foam upon the hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
rocks. But the larger and higher the wave, the farther it recedes.
Leopold stood firm, though he was shaken in every fibre of his frame by
the shock. The retiring water—retiring only for an instant, to come
again with even greater fury-gave him his opportunity, and he improved
it. Swooping, like a strong eagle, beneath the narrow shelf of rock, he
gained the broader sands beyond the reach of the mad billows. It blew
a hurricane for some time. The stranded yacht was ground into little pieces
by the sharp rocks, but her skipper and his fair passenger were safe.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the boy, musing gloomily apart,</span>
<span class="i0">Avowed at length the impulse of his heart:</span>

<span class="i0">By thine whole life imperfectly adored;</span>
<span class="i0">But choose thy work amid the world, and then</span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst serve God, and bless thy fellow-men.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The boy, still yearning to achieve his plan,</span>
<span class="i0">Spake: “It were better to serve God than man.”</span>

<span class="i0">So Arnulph to his chamber went, and prayed</span>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High o’er the snow-capped peaks of blue the stars are out to-night,</span>
<span class="i0">And the silver crescent moon hangs low. I watched it on my right,</span>
<span class="i0">Moving above the pine-tops tall, a bright and gentle shape,</span>
<span class="i0">While I listened to the tales you told of peril and escape.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, mingled with your voices low, I heard the rumbling sound</span>
<span class="i0">Of wheels adown the farther slope, that sought the level ground;</span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly, from memories that never can grow dim,</span>
<span class="i0">Flashed out once more the day when last I rode with English Jem.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Twas here, in wild Montana, I took my hero’s gauge.</span>
<span class="i0">From Butte to Deer Lodge, four-in-hand, he drove the mountain stage;</span>
<span class="i0">And many a time, in sun or storm, safe mounted at his side,</span>
<span class="i0">I whiled away with pleasant talk the long day’s weary ride.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jem’s faithful steeds had served him long, of mettle true and tried:</span>
<span class="i0">One sought in vain for trace of blows upon their glossy hide;</span>
<span class="i0">And to each low command he spoke, the leader’s nervous ear</span>
<span class="i0">Bent eager, as a lover waits his mistress’ voice to hear.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With ringing crack the leathern whip, that else had idly hung,</span>
<span class="i0">Kept time for many a rapid mile to English songs he sung;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, despite his smile, he seemed a lonely man to be,</span>
<span class="i0">With not one soul to claim him kin on this side of the sea.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But after I had known him long, one mellow evening-time</span>
<span class="i0">He told me of his English Rose, who withered in her prime;</span>
<span class="i0">And how, within the churchyard green, he laid her down to rest</span>
<span class="i0">With her sweet babe, a blighted bud, upon her frozen breast.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I could not stay,” he said, “where she had left me all alone!</span>
<span class="i0">The very hedge-rose that she loved, I could not look upon.</span>
<span class="i0">I could not hear the mavis sing, or see the long grass wave,</span>
<span class="i0">And every little daisy-bank seemed but my darling’s grave.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Yet somehow—why, I cannot tell—but when I wandered here,</span>
<span class="i0">I seemed to bring her with me too, that once had been so dear.</span>
<span class="i0">I love these mountain summits, where the world is in the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">For she is in it too,—my love!—and so I bring her nigh.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next week I rode with Jem again. The coach was full, that day,</span>
<span class="i0">And there were little children there, that pleased us with their play.</span>
<span class="i0">A sweet-faced mother brought her pair of rosy, bright-eyed girls,</span>
<span class="i0">And boy like one I left at home, with silken yellow curls.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We took fresh horses at Girard’s, and as he led them out—</span>
<span class="i0">A vicious pair they seemed to me—I heard the hostler shout,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<span class="i0">“You always want good horses, Jem! Now you shall have your way.</span>
<span class="i0">Try these new beauties, for we sold your old team yesterday.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O’er clean-cut limb and sloping flank, arched neck and tossing head,</span>
<span class="i0">I marked Jem run his practised eye, though not a word he said;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet, as he clambered to his seat, and took the reins once more,</span>
<span class="i0">I saw a look upon his face it had not worn before.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hostler open flung the gates. “Now, Tempest, show your pace,”</span>
<span class="i0">He cried, and with a careless hand he struck the leader’s face.</span>
<span class="i0">The horse, beneath the sportive blow, reared as if poison-stung;</span>
<span class="i0">And, with his panic-stricken mates, to a mad gallop sprung.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We thundered through the gate, and out upon the stony road;</span>
<span class="i0">From side to side the great coach lurched, with all its priceless load:</span>
<span class="i0">Some cried aloud for help, and some, with terror-frozen tongue,</span>
<span class="i0">Clung, bruised and faint in every limb, the weaker to the strong.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And men who oft had looked on death, unblanched, by flood or field,</span>
<span class="i0">When every nerve to do and dare by agony was steeled,</span>
<span class="i0">Now moaned aloud, or gnashed their teeth in helpless rage,</span>
<span class="i0">To die, at whim of maddened brutes, like vermin in a cage!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Too well, alas! too well I knew the awful way we went,—</span>
<span class="i0">The little stretch of level road, and then the steep descent;</span>
<span class="i0">The boiling stream that seethed and roared far down the rocky ridge,</span>
<span class="i0">With death, like old Horatius, grim waiting at the bridge!</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, suddenly, above the din, a voice rang loud and clear;</span>
<span class="i0">We knew it well, the driver’s voice,—without one note of fear;</span>
<span class="i0">Some strong, swift angel’s lips might thrill with such a clarion cry,—</span>
<span class="i0">The voice of one who put for aye all earthly passion by:—</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Still! for your lives, and listen! See yon farmhouse by the way,</span>
<span class="i0">And piled along the field in front the shocks of new-mown hay.</span>
<span class="i0">God help me turn my horses there! And when I give the word,</span>
<span class="i0">Leap on the hay! Pray, every soul, to Him who Israel heard!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Within, the coach was still. ’Tis strange, but never till I die</span>
<span class="i0">Shall I forget the fields that day, the color of the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">The summer breeze that brought the first sweet perfume of the hay,</span>
<span class="i0">The bobolink that in the grass would sing his life away.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One breathless moment bridged the space that lay between, and then</span>
<span class="i0">Jem drew upon the straining reins, with all the strength of ten.</span>
<span class="i0">“Hold fast the babes!” More close I clasped the fair boy at my side.</span>
<span class="i0">“Let every nerve be steady now!” and “Jump for life!” he cried.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saved, every soul! Oh! dizzy—sweet life rushed in every vein,</span>
<span class="i0">To us who from that fragrant bed rose up to hope again!</span>
<span class="i0">But, ’mid the smiles and grateful tears that mingled on each cheek,</span>
<span class="i0">A sudden questioning horror grew, that none would dare to speak.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Too soon the answer struck our ears! One moment’s hollow roar</span>
<span class="i0">Of flying hoofs upon the bridge—an awful crash that tore</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The very air in twain—and then, through all the world grown still,</span>
<span class="i0">I only heard the bobolink go singing at his will.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I was the first man down the cliff. There’s little left to tell.</span>
<span class="i0">We found him lying, breathing yet and conscious, where he fell.</span>
<span class="i0">The question in his eager eyes, I answered with a word,—</span>
<span class="i0">“Safe!” Then he smiled, and whispered low some words I scarcely heard.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We would have raised him, but his lips grew white with agony.</span>
<span class="i0">“Not yet; it will be over soon,” he whispered. “Wait with me;”</span>
<span class="i0">Then, lower, smiling still, “It is my last ride, friends; but I</span>
<span class="i0">Have done my duty, and God knows I do not fear to die.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He closed his eyes. We watched his life slip, like an ebbing tide,</span>
<span class="i0">Far out upon the infinite, where all our hopes abide.</span>
<span class="i0">He spoke but once again, a name not meant for mortal ears,</span>
<span class="i0">“My Rose!” She must have heard that call, amid the singing spheres!</span>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Well, mother, as our advertisement appeared in the paper last
evening, I suppose we may expect any amount of answers in the shape of
Irish girls.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Quite likely; and I must confess I dread the ordeal. It
is better, however, to advertise, and have the girls call at the house,
than to seek them at the intelligence office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Oh, yes, indeed! I made a vow the last time you sent me there
for a girl, that if I could possibly help it I would never enter such a
place again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Well, I hope our present plan will be successful, and
we shall be fortunate enough to secure a good girl. If we had less
company, and our family were not so large, we would try to do the work
together, and get along without help.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> I wish we might, mother. I have often felt, after the
disorderly reign of some tyrannical Bridget, that I would like to
banish them all from whence they came, and wield the kitchen sceptre
alone. (<i>Bell rings.</i>) There comes number one, I’ll warrant.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bridget Rooney</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> The top of the mornin’ to ye, ma’am; and sure is yer name
Mervin?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> It is; and I suppose you have come to answer my
advertisement for a girl.</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> Indade I have, ma’am. Is it a cook ye would be afther
wantin’?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> I wish a girl to do general housework, and of course
that includes a knowledge of plain cooking. Would you like such a place?</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> And sure I can’t tell, ma’am, till I ax ye a few questions,
and finds out the characther of the place intirely. What wages do ye give?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Three dollars.</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> And how many have ye in the family, ma’am?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Seven persons.</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> Well, indade, and if ever I heard the like! Sivin persons,
and only three dollars wages! Shure me cousin, Kate Murphy, gits four
dollars, and there’s only three in the house. I’ll come for no three
dollars, unless yer house has all the modern convainyences. Do ye have
gas in the kitchen and girl’s room?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> We have gas in the kitchen, but we do not think it
necessary in the girl’s sleeping-room.</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> And, faith, it’s as much wanted there as anywhere. A poor
girl doesn’t want to be groping about with a nasty kerosene-lamp. How
much time in a week do you give a girl to herself, ma’am?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> One afternoon and evening a week. I believe that is a general rule.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> It’s not a rule I goes by, ma’am. I wants two afternoons a
week, and every evenin’ besides, and I’m used to have my friends come
whenever I like.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> I see you wouldn’t suit me at all, so you had better not
remain here any longer. I don’t intend to pay a girl wages, and give
her half her time besides.</p>

<p><i>Bridget.</i> And shure yer no lady, ma’am; and I wouldn’t set fut in yer
house if ye’d give me five dollars a week, bad luck to ye.</p>

<p class="author">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bridget</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Not a very promising specimen to begin with, surely.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> I should think not, indeed. The idea of her asking four dollars
a week, and wanting, as you said, nearly half her time! (<i>Bell rings.</i>)
There’s another. I shall find full employment in tending the door-bell,
at this rate.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Yes, I advertised for one yesterday. Can you do general
housework?</p>

<p><i>Norah.</i> Faith I can, ma’am; it’s a gineral’s housework I’ve been
doing, and I might have staid in the place foriver, only that herself
was that fussy that niver a soul could plaze her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Can you make good bread?</p>

<p><i>Norah.</i> Good bread is it ye say? And indade I can make that same. I
makes it with imtens, ma’am; and if it sours a bit, I puts a handful of
salerathus into it, and it comes out of the oven as swate as a nut, and
a fine color on it besides.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Dear me! I should think it might have a fine color with a
handful of saleratus in it!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> At what other place have you lived besides the one you
mentioned?</p>

<p><i>Norah.</i> Nowheres at all, ma’am; that’s the first place I wint when I
came from the ould counthry.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> How long did you live there, and what part of the work
did you do?</p>

<p><i>Norah.</i> Well, ma’am, I lived there three weeks, ’liven days, and
a fortnight—barrin’ the two days that I staid out to take care of
me cousin Mike; and I did the fine work, mostly, ma’am,—scrubbing, sifting
ashes, and ’the likes of that. Do ye think ye would like to hire me, ma’am?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> I guess not. I am afraid you haven’t had experience
enough to do my work properly.</p>

<p><i>Norah.</i> Well, ma’am, if that’s any thing I could buy at the store, I
would be willing to spend a thrifle to get some, for the sake of livin’
wid ye.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Experience in housework cannot be bought at the stores;
so you had better look somewhere else for a place.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Well, mother, did you ever hear of such stupidity before?</p>

will come next? (<i>Bell rings.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> A fine day, ma’am. Is it yerself that wants a girl?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Yes, if I can find a good one; but I am sorry to say
they seem to be growing very scarce.</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> You are mistaken there, ma’am; it’s good places that’s gittin’
scarce. How big a family do ye have?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> There are seven of us, and we of course have company
occasionally.</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> That’s too many intirely; but I s’pose with all thim ye keep
two girls and a man besides.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> No, we keep but one servant.</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> Servint is it! Well, ma’am, that’s what I niver allows meself
to be called. What sort of convainyences is there in the house? Is
there a rocking-chair in the kitchen, where I can rest meself while the
pot’s a-bilin’?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> No, I don’t consider that a necessary article of kitchen
furniture.</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> We differs there, ma’am; I can’t do without a rocking-chair. I
see you have a pianny. I s’pose ye wouldn’t mind if I learned to play
on it afther me work is done—would ye?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> I should object very strongly to giving a girl such a
privilege.</p>

<p><i>Ellen.</i> Well, ma’am, it’s gittin’ quite the fashion for the ladies
that live out to play. Me cousin Kate Donnelly plays “St. Pathrick’s
Day in the Mornin’,” and “Rory O’More,” illigant; and I’ve made up me mind
I’ll live in no place agin where I can’t have the chance to play the pianny.

It isn’t worth while for me to spend any more time talking with you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Oh, dear! I don’t like so much bluing in my clothes.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Faith, thin, I’ll jist lave out the blue a few times, and
they’ll be as fine a yaller as ye wish; any thing to suit ye, ma’am.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Can you do common cooking?</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> I niver does any thing common, miss; all I cooks is in the
fust style. I can make Meringo pies that would melt in your mouth,
Charlotte Russians, and Blue Munge, too.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Indeed! you seem quite like an adept in cooking.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> I don’t know what an adipt is; but if you mean I’m a good
cook, I am that. Ye ought to see the fine roast pig I cooked the other
day; sich a handsome baste was niver set before on a gintleman’s table,
I’ll warrant.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> You seem to despise common cooking. I have very little
else done in my family. We live quite plainly, and I hardly think you
would suit me.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Well, now, ma’am, we won’t let the cooking come betwixt us. I
can cook plain, if I like; so, if ye plaze, I’d like to come and try.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Can you bring me a certificate of good character from
the lady who last employed you?</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> A stifkit! What’s that, shure?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> A paper, stating what character you bear.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Indade, ma’am, I niver carries my charactercher round in a
dirty piece of paper, that’s liable to be torn up any day. I thinks
more of meself than that.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Very well; I cannot take you, unless you can bring me
such a paper.</p>

<p><i>Joanna.</i> Faith, ye won’t have the chance; and I’m thinkin’ it’ll be a
long time before ye gets suited. Ye’ll find no dacent girl will carry
her charactercher loose in her hand.</p>

<p class="author">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Joanna</span>.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Another verdant specimen. These interviews grow interesting.
I’m beginning to enjoy them. I wonder who will come next? (<i>Bell
rings.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> We shall soon see who has given the bell such a gentle
pull.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Angelina Simper</span>.</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Are you the lady who manifested her desire to secure an
assistant in her family, by inserting an advertisement in “The Gazette”
of last evening?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Yes; I advertised for a servant-girl. Do you wish such a
situation?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> I might be induced, madam, to accept a position in your
family for a sufficient consideration.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Are you familiar with housework?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Yes, in a certain way. I am in the habit of idealizing and
etherealizing every thing which I undertake. I think I have discovered
the method of extracting the poetry from housework; and instead of
regarding it as a wearisome drudgery, I make it a grand poem.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> I think you must be an inventive genius if you can find any
poetry in washing greasy dishes, or scrubbing kitchen floors.</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Ah, miss, there is poetry in every thing. I revel in it,
morning, noon, and night. Its glorious beams brighten my pathway at
every step of my earthly progress. I have written a volume of sweet
verses; and if they can only be properly brought before the public,
my name will be immortalized, and the poet’s laurels forever crown my
brow. It is to gain a sufficient sum to publish this gem among poetical
works, that I have decided, for a short time, to put in practice my
ideal method of housekeeping.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Can you make bread, and do up shirts?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Yes: I can insert the rising element in a liquid form into
the snowy flour; or I can use those subtile powders that permeate the
mass of doughy particles, and make them rise in comely proportions.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> Indeed! but how about the shirts?</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Well, after bringing them in from their bath in the
sunlight, I immerse them in starch of pearly whiteness, and after
sufficient time has elapsed I press to their bosoms a hot iron. I am
reminded by this that only through fiery trials we can be made to shine
with becoming lustre ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> I think you will have to find some other place in which
to practise your fine ideas of housework. You soar quite too high for us.</p>

<p><i>Angelina.</i> Adieu; this weary birdling seeks another nest.</p>

<p class="author">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Angelina</span>.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> O, mother! I thought I should burst out laughing in her face.
She is an escaped lunatic, I do believe.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> I should think she was. (<i>Bell rings.</i>) There’s another;
this time an artist, perhaps. I’ll go straight to the office, and have
that advertisement taken out.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Is this Mrs. Mervin who advertised for a girl?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Yes, I am the lady. Do you know of any good girl?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I would like to get a place myself. I have worked in a shop
since I left my home in the country, three years ago; but I find the
confinement doesn’t agree with me, and I had rather do housework.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> You understand it, then, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh, yes! I am next to the oldest in a family of nine children,
and my mother commenced teaching me to do housework almost as soon as
I could go alone. As soon as the sister next me could take my place, I
left home to see if I could earn something to help along. A man like
my father, with a small farm and a large family of children, finds it
rather hard to get along sometimes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Yes, he must find it hard to feed and clothe so many,
with so little ready money as farmers generally have. You are a dutiful
daughter to endeavor to assist him what you can; but would your parents
approve of your living out in the city?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Yes: ever since my side has ached with such constant sewing,
mother has been urging me to live out; and I should have tried to
get a place long before this, only I dreaded so much to go to an
intelligence-office. When I saw your advertisement, I decided to apply
here immediately.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> I am very glad you did, for I should like to engage you
without further delay. How soon can you come?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> To-night, if you wish; my week is out at my boarding-place, and
I shouldn’t care to commence another.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Very well, you can come, then, and I will give you three
dollars a week. Will that be satisfactory?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Quite so: that is more than I clear some weeks now; and it will
be such a relief to have done with so much sewing. Good-morning, ma’am.
I’ll be here about five o’clock.</p>

<p class="author">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.</p>

<p><i>Emma.</i> There, mother, see what has come by advertising in a
respectable paper. I think you have secured a jewel,—so tidy and
civil,—and I know by her looks she knows how to do every thing.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Mervin.</i> Yes, I am greatly pleased with her appearance; and how
much more sensible in her to do housework than kill herself sewing in
a shop! I hope the time will soon come when a great many more in her
circumstances will go and do likewise.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="JOHN_LELANDS" id="JOHN_LELANDS"></a>JOHN LELAND’S EXAMINATION.</h3></div>

<p>Up on the heights in the Old Dominion, where the houses are few, and
many of the mountaineers know little of the settlements below, a man
of God lived who took to preaching the gospel in his own rude way.
He was a man of strong character and clear common sense. He could
just read the Bible—that was all; but he got at the heart of things
as his ministry showed, and drew near to the heart of his Master. He
was a very plain preacher, a most careless and unguarded man. He told
the people the truth without any apologies, with all kindness and
tenderness of heart. Many were turned from sin unto righteousness; and
the presbytery, in whose bounds his work was, determined to ordain him,
simply on the ground of his efficiency and clear call to the ministry,
though he had no education. He objected. They persisted. Finally the
day was appointed, and a large company from the mountains and the
valleys below gathered to witness the examination for licensing and
ordination of this strange character. All knew that there would be
something entertaining in his answers. The presbytery assembled, the
congregation looking on. John Leland took his place in front, dropping
his head into his hands. The moderator simply stated the object of the
meeting, addressing Mr. Leland. The latter looked up and said,—
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9a" id="Page_9a">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Moderator, I’ll tell you all I know. It won’t take long,” and down
his head went into his hands again. A smile went around the assembly.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Mr. Leland, do you believe that God had a people, chosen
and elect before the foundations of the world?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> I don’t know what God was doin’ before he made the world.
Don’t know any thin’ about it. I a’n’t a educated man.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Yes, but you must understand me. You certainly believe
that God had a people chosen and elect from all eternity?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> No. I don’t believe that. They couldn’t a’ been our kind o’
folks, anyway; because ours are made out of the dust of the earth, you know.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Mr. Leland, we have heard of your Christian life, of
your efficiency and your success, and we are met to ordain you to the
ministry of the gospel. This is a solemn occasion, and you must not
make light of the questions. Now, I want to know if you believe in the
total depravity of mankind?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> No, I don’t, if you mean by that that men are as bad as they
can be; for the Devil a’n’t any worse’n that, you know.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Do you believe in imputed righteousness, and that it is
sufficient to save all who have faith?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> I don’t know any righteousness that will save a man who won’t
do right himself.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Do you believe in the final perseverance of the saints?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> I don’t know what that means.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Well, you believe that all who are converted will be kept,
and not fall away?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> Oh, I don’t know how it is down in the settlements, among the
educated; but I tell you up where we live, we have the awfulest cases
of backsliding.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> But, Mr. Leland, you certainly believe that when a man is
converted he will be kept in some way, and finally saved?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> I cannot tell much about that, till I am saved myself. Don’t
know any thing about it now.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> You feel that you are called to preach the gospel?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10a" id="Page_10a">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> No, I never heard any one call me.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> We do not mean that you heard a voice—any thing said—but
that you are called.</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> Well, Mr. Moderator, if there wasn’t any voice, or any thing
said, don’t know how there could be any call. Never heard any.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> You believe it is your duty to preach the gospel to all
creatures?</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> No. I don’t believe it my duty to preach to the Dutch, for
instance. I can’t talk Dutch. If the Lord wanted me to preach to them,
in some way I could talk Dutch; but I can’t, I never tried.</p>

<p><i>Moderator.</i> Mr. Leland, you certainly desire to see all men come to
repentance, and turn to righteousness. Your acts show that. We have
heard of your self-sacrificing spirit, your love for mankind, and all
your good works to win sinners to the gospel and repentance.</p>

<p><i>Leland.</i> Mr. Moderator, I’ll tell you the honest truth. I am a little
ashamed of it; but it is God’s truth just as I tell you. Some days I do
feel that way; and then again, some of them act so bad, I don’t care if
the Devil gets half of them.</p>

<p>After the presbytery had retired to take counsel over the matter, they
returned and announced that while his answers had not been entirely
satisfactory in every respect, nevertheless, in view of his efficiency
in preaching, they had voted to ordain him, which they proceeded to
do in the usual manner. After it was over, Mr. Leland lifted his head
out of his hands, straightened himself up, and stood his full height.
Looking first at the moderator, and then all round him, he said,—</p>

<p>“Brethren, I’ve put you to a heap o’ trouble. I don’t know any thin’
about your doctrines, ’n’ I told you I didn’t. I’ve been doin’ the best
I could, preachin’ the gospel as I found it in the Bible. Now, you
see, I don’t know any thing else. Another thing: when the apostles put
their hands on a man’s head, I read that the man had some power, or
some sense, or some knowledge, that he hadn’t afore. But now, brethren,
honest and true, right out, you’ve all had your hands on me, and I am
just as big a fool as ever I was. But I thank you, nevertheless: I’m
very much obleeged to you.”</p>

<p>And so they let him go.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="LAUGHING_PHILOSOPHER" id="LAUGHING_PHILOSOPHER"></a>A LAUGHING PHILOSOPHER.</h3></div>

<p>Admiring my flowers, sir? P’raps you’d step inside the gate, and
walk round my little place? It ain’t big, but there’s plenty of
variety,—violets and cabbages, roses and artichokes. Any one that
didn’t care for flowers ’ud be sure to find beauty in them young spring
onions. People’s ideas differ very much, there ain’t a doubt of it. One
man’s very happy over a glass of whiskey and water, and another thinks
every thing ’ud go straight in this ’ere world if we all drank tea and
lemonade. And it’s right enough: it keeps things even. We should have
the world a very one-sided affair if everybody pulled the same way.
Philosopher, am I? Well, I dunno. I’ve got a theory to be sure—every
one has nowadays; and mine is, that there is a joke to be found in
every mortal thing if only we look in the right place for it. But some
people don’t know how to look for it. Why, sir, if you’ll believe it, I
was talking to a man yesterday that couldn’t see any thing to laugh at
in the naval demonstration.</p>

<p>Am I independent? Well, I makes money by my fruit and vegetables, if
that’s what you mean. But there’s so many ways of being independent.
One man marries a woman with £20,000 a year, and calls that
independence. Another votes on the strongest side, and calls that being
independent. One takes up every new-fangled idea that comes out, and
says he’s independent. Some calls impudence independence. There’s not
a name as fits so many different articles. No! I’ve never bin married.
Somehow, I don’t think married men see the fun in every thing same as
single ones. I don’t mean to be disrespectful to the ladies, but I do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18a" id="Page_18a">[Pg 18]</a></span>
think they enjoy a good cry more than a good laugh. Was I ever in love?
and did I laugh then? Why, yes, never laughed heartier in my life. It’s
a good many years ago now. I was living in lodgings down Clerkenwell
way, and the landlady’s daughter was as pretty a creature as ever
you see, bright and cheery, like a robin, when first I knew her.
But, by and by, she grew pale and peaky,—used to go about the house
without singing, and had such big, sad-looking eyes. Her home wasn’t
a particularly happy one, for her mother was a nagger. Perhaps you’ve
never come across a woman of that pertikler character. Well, then, you
should say double the prayers of ordinary people; for you’ve much to be
thankful for. I never looked at her without feeling that her husband
must have been very happy indeed when he got to heaven. I sometimes
think, sir, that women of this sort might be made use of, and prisons,
and all other kind of punishment, done away with: perhaps, though, the
lunatic asylums ’ud get too full.</p>

<p>Well, I grew to be quite intimate with Bessie; and one evening, I don’t
know how it was, she told me all her troubles. She was engaged to a
young man; and her mother wouldn’t consent to them marrying, and was
always worrying her to break it off. I asked her if there were any
thing against him. Nothing, except that her mother had taken a dislike
to him: he wasn’t very strong, but he was the best, cleverest, dearest
fellow that ever lived. All the time she was talking I felt a gnawing
sort of pain somewhere in my inside. First, I thought I must be hungry;
but, when I came to eat, all my food seemed to get in my throat, and
stick there. This won’t do, old fellow, thinks I: there must be a joke
to be got out of it somewhere. So I set to consider; and there, clear
enough, it was. Why, the joke ’ud be to let Bessie marry her young man,
and see the pretty cheeks grow round and pink again. But how to do it,
there was the rub. I began to cultivate the old lady’s society with a
view to finding out her weak point: for, being a woman, of course she
had a weak point; and, being a very ugly woman, what do you think it
was? Why, vanity, to be sure. I soon noticed a change in her. She took
her hair out of paper every day, instead of only on Sundays, as she
had been used to do; and she put on a clean cap sometimes, and smirked
whenever I passed her. Why, here’s a bigger joke than I bargained for,
thinks I! While I’ve been studying the woman to find out her weak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19a" id="Page_19a">[Pg 19]</a></span>
point, she thinks I’ve been admiring her. But I soon saw what use
I could make of this. I went down into the kitchen when she wasn’t
busy,—I knew it would be rather too hot other times,—and I got
talking about Bessie. “It’s strange,” I says, “that a fine-looking girl
like that shouldn’t have a sweetheart. Things was different when you
was younger, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p>“As for that,” says she, “Bessie has a sweetheart; but I don’t approve
of him. He’s not exactly the sort of man I expected for her.”</p>

<p>“But, lor’,” I says, “you wouldn’t go and keep that girl single! Think
what harm you may do yourself. You can’t be so cruel as to give up
all idea of marrying agin! Why, you don’t look forty.” That wasn’t
an untruth, for she looked fifty. She tossed her head, and told me
to go along. I didn’t go along. I says, “There’s no doubt lots of
young fellows ’ud be glad enough of a good-looking wife like you, but
mightn’t care for a daughter as old as Miss Bessie.” This seemed to
strike her very much. I followed it up, got talking to her day after
day, and always led the conversation to the same point. At last one day
when I came home from work, she says, “It’s all settled. Bessie’s going
to be married, and her Tom’s coming here this evening.” Then I went up
to my own room, and laughed till I cried. Presently I heard the little
girl run up-stairs as she hadn’t run for many a long day, and I knew
she’d gone to put on a smart ribbon for Tom’s sake. She tapped at my
door as she passed. Would I come down? somebody was there, and wanted
to know me. I called out that I was busy, and couldn’t come; and she
went away. But after about an hour she came again. I was sitting in the
dark, thinking of a good many things; and before I had time to speak
she was down on her knees beside me, and hiding her face.</p>

<p>“You told me you were busy,” she said; “and here you are all in the
dark and cold, and I can’t bear any one to be dull or lonely to-night,
because I’m so very, very happy. And I know it’s all through you.
Mother would never have given in of her own accord. You’ve always been
my friend when I wanted one very badly; and now you must be angry with
me, or you wouldn’t stay away to-night. And you won’t even speak to me.
Oh, whatever I’ve done to vex you, don’t think of it any more!”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20a" id="Page_20a">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>She nestled up to me so close that her hair touched my coat-sleeve, and
her pretty eyes looked up all swimming with tears. I ground my teeth,
and clinched my hands, or—or I don’t know what I mightn’t ha’ done.
You see the joke of this, sir, don’t you? Here was the girl crying, and
asking me to forgive her, and like her a little; and there was I—not
disliking her a bit all the time. Ha, ha, ha! I had a hearty laugh at
her, and hurried with her down-stairs, and was introduced to Tom, and
I talked to the old lady, and drank the young people’s health, and was
as happy as possible. And on the wedding-day I gave her away as if I
had been her father; and I sang a song and danced: and, when the time
came for Bessie to go away with her husband, I dried her eyes; for at
the last moment the tender-hearted little thing broke down, and cried,
and kissed us all, and asked her mother not to feel angry with her for
leaving her all alone; and then the mother cried, and what with having
so many eyes to wipe, I found myself wiping my own just as if it all
weren’t a tremendous joke.</p>

<p>How have they got on since? ’Bout as well as most people, I suppose;
she loves him, and takes care of him. And the mother’s softened down
a bit since she’s bin a grandmother. And as to my godson, there
never was such a boy. I have him with me as much as possible, and he’s
beginning to see the joke of every thing almost as much as I do myself.
And when I die, all this little place’ll belong to him, and he’ll be a
rich man: so my death’ll be the biggest joke of all, you see, sir.</p>

<p>“But, Uncle Remus, Brother Possum didn’t steal the butter after all,”
said the little boy, who was not at all satisfied with such summary
injustice.</p>

<p>“Dat w’at make I say w’at I duz, honey. In dis worrul, lots er folks is

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="LOVES" id="LOVES"></a>THE LOVES OF A LIFE.</h3></div>

<p>Love! Love is the flight of the soul towards God, towards the great,
the sublime, and the beautiful, which are the shadow of God upon earth.
Love your family, the partner of your life, those around you ready to
share your joys and sorrows, the dead who were dear to you, and to
whom you were dear. But let your love be the love taught you by Dante
and by us,—the love of souls that aspire together, and do not grovel
on the earth in search of a felicity which is not the destiny of the
creature here to reach; do not yield to a delusion which inevitably
would degrade you into egotism. To love, is to promise, and to receive
a promise for the future. God has given us love, that the weary soul
may give and receive support upon the way of life. It is a flower which
springs up on the path of duty, but which cannot change its course.
Purify, strengthen, and improve yourselves by loving. Ever act—even
at the price of increasing her earthly trials—so that the sister soul
united to your own may never need, here or elsewhere, to blush through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30a" id="Page_30a">[Pg 30]</a></span>
you or for you. The time will come when from the height of a new life,
embracing the whole past and comprehending its secret, you will smile
together at the sorrows you have endured, the trials you have overcome.</p>

<p>Love your country. Your country is the land where your parents sleep,
where is spoken that language in which the chosen of your heart,
blushing, whispered the first word of love; it is the house that God
has given you, that, by striving to perfect yourselves therein, you
may prepare to ascend to him. It is your name, your glory, your sign
among the peoples. Give to it your thought, your counsel, your blood.
Raise it up, great and beautiful, as foretold by our great men. And
see that you leave it uncontaminated by any trace of falsehood, or of
servitude, unprofaned by dismemberment. Let it be one, as the thought
of God. You are twenty-four millions of men, endowed with active,
splendid faculties, with a tradition of glory the envy of the nations
of Europe; an immense future is before you, your eyes are raised to the
loveliest heaven, and around you smiles the loveliest land in Europe;
you are encircled by the Alps and the sea, boundaries marked out by
the finger of God for a people of giants. And you must be such, or
nothing. Let not a man of that twenty-four millions remain excluded
from the fraternal bond which shall join you together; let not a look
be raised to that heaven, which is not that of a free man. Let Rome
be the ark of your redemption, the temple of your nation. Has she not
twice been the temple of the destinies of Europe? In Rome two extinct
worlds, the Pagan and the Papal, meet each other like the double jewels
of a diadem; and you must draw from thence a third world, greater than
the other two. From Rome, the Holy City, the City of Love (<i>Amor</i>),
the purest and wisest among you, elected by the vote, and strengthened
by the inspiration, of a whole people, shall give forth the pact that
shall unite us in one, and represent us in the future alliance of the
peoples. Until then you have no country, or you have it contaminated.</p>

<p>Love humanity. You can only ascertain your own mission from the aim
placed by God before humanity at large. God has given you your country
as cradle, humanity as mother, and you can only love your brethren of
the cradle in loving your common mother. Beyond the Alps, beyond the
sea, are other peoples, now fighting, or preparing to fight, the holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31a" id="Page_31a">[Pg 31]</a></span>
fight of independence, of nationality, of liberty: other peoples
striving by different routes to reach the same goal,—improvement,
association, and the foundation of an authority which shall put an end
to moral anarchy, and link again earth to heaven, and which mankind
may love and obey without remorse or shame. Unite with them, they will
unite with you. Do not invoke their aid where your single arm can
suffice to conquer; but say to them, that the hour will shortly sound
for a terrible struggle between right and blind force, and that in that
hour you will ever be found with those who have raised the same banner
as yourselves.</p>

<p>And love, young men, love and reverence above every thing the ideal.
The ideal is the word of God, superior to every country, superior to
humanity; it is the country of the spirit, the city of the soul, in
which all are brethren who believe in the inviolability of thought,
and in the dignity of our immortal soul; and the baptism of this
fraternity is martyrdom. From that high sphere spring the <i>principles</i>
which alone can redeem the peoples. Arise for them! and not from
impatience of suffering, or dread of evil. Anger, pride, ambition, and
the desire of material prosperity are arms common to the peoples and
their oppressors; and, even should you conquer with them to-day, you
will fall again to-morrow: but principles belong to the peoples alone,
and their oppressors can find no arms to oppose them. Adore enthusiasm.
Worship the dreams of the virgin soul, and the visions of early youth,
for they are the perfume of paradise, which the soul preserves in
issuing from the hands of its Creator. Respect above all things your
conscience; have upon your lips the truth that God has placed in your
hearts, and, while working together in harmony in all that tends to the
emancipation of our soil, even with those who differ from you, yet ever
bear erect your own banner, and boldly promulgate your faith.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="AUNT_SOPHRONIA" id="AUNT_SOPHRONIA"></a>AUNT SOPHRONIA TABOR AT THE OPERA.</h3></div>

<p>“So this is the uproar? Well, isn’t this a monster big building?
And that chantieleer! It’s got a thousand candles if it has one. It
must have taken a sight of tallow to have run them all!”—“They are
make-believe candles, aunt, with little jets of gas inside to give the
effect of real ones.”—“I want to know! Well, I only wish that your
uncle Peleg was here. You’re sure, Louisa, that this is a perfectly
proper place?”—“Why, aunt, you don’t suppose that papa would consent
to our attending the opera if it were other than a perfectly proper
place, do you?”—“No, no, dear; I suppose not. But somehow you city
folks look upon such things differently from what we do who live in the
country. Dear suz! Louisa, do look way up there in the tiptop of the
house! Did you ever see such a sight of people? Why, excursion-trains
must have run from all over the State. Massy, child! There’s a woman
forgot her bonnet! Do just nudge her, Louisa, and tell her of it. My
Eliza Ann cut just such a caper as that one Sunday last summer,—got
clean into the meeting-house, and half way down the middle aisle,
before she discovered it, and the whole congregation a-giggling and
a-tittering. Your cousin Woodman Harrison shook the whole pew; and
I don’t know but what he’d ’a’ hawhawed right out in meeting if his
father hadn’t ’a’ given him one of his looks. As ’twas, I was afeard
he’d bust a blood-vessel. Just speak to that poor creature, Louisa.
She’ll feel awfully cut up when she finds it out, and ’tis a Christian
duty to tell her.”—“Why, aunt, don’t you know that she is in full
dress, and left her bonnet at home intentionally? See how beautifully
her hair is arranged. You don’t suppose she wanted to cover up all that
elegance, do you?”—“Come bareheaded a-purpose! Well, I do declare!
But, Louisa, where’s the horse-chestnut?”—“The horse-chestnut,
aunt?”—“Yes, child; you said something or other about a horse-chestnut
playing a voluntary or something of that sort.”—“Oh, the orchestra!
Yes, I remember. Don’t you see those gentlemen in front of the
stage?”—“Them men with the fiddles and the bass-viols?”—“Yes. Well,
they compose the orchestra, and the orchestral part of this opera is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37a" id="Page_37a">[Pg 37]</a></span>
particularly fine.”—“I want to know! Belong to the first families, I
suppose. They are an uncommon good-looking set of men. Is Mrs. Patte a
furrener?”—“Yes; she’s a mixture of Spanish and Italian. She was born
in Madrid, but came to the United States when only five years of age,
and remained here until she was nearly seventeen. There, aunt; there’s
the bell, and the curtain will rise in a minute. Yes; see, there it
goes.”—“Louisa!”—“Sh—! listen. I want you to hear Signor Monti. He
is considered a very fine bass.”—“But, Louisa, oughtn’t we to stand
up during prayer-time?”—“You forget, aunt, that this is only a play,
and not a temple.”—“Dear suz! I only wish your uncle Peleg was here.
Somehow it seems kinder unchristian to be play-acting worship.”—“Why,
aunt, there’s no need of your feeling so conscience-stricken. Lots
of church-people come to the opera. It isn’t like the theatre, you
know. It’s more—more—er—well, I can’t just express it, aunt. But,
anyway, people who discountenance the theatre, especially during Lent,
approve of the opera.”—“But, Louisa, what is the matter? La sakes,
child! let’s get out as spry as ever we can! The theatre is all on
fire. Hurry, Louisa! Wish that your uncle Peleg”—“Sh—aunt; do sit
down. It isn’t a fire. It’s only the people applauding because Patti
is on the stage. Don’t you see her?”—“Sakes alive! Is that it? I
thought we was all afire, or Wiggin’s flood had come. So that is Mrs.
Patte. Well, I declare for it! she’s as spry as a cricket, and no
mistake. Why, Louisa, how old is she? She looks scarcely out of her
teens.”—“Oh, aunt, you must not be so practical, and ask such personal
questions. Ladies don’t always want their ages known; but, between
ourselves, she’s over forty.”—“Is it possible? There, they’re at it
again. What is the matter now?”—“Why, Scalchi has appeared. Don’t you
see?”—“What, that dapper little fellow a-bowing and a-scraping and
a-smirking! Is that Mr. Scalchi?”—“That’s Madame Scalchi, aunt; and
she’s taking the part of Arsaces, the commander of the Assyrian army,
you know.”—“Louisa, are you sure that this is a perfectly proper
place? I only wish Peleg was here, for then I shouldn’t feel so sort
a-skerry like and guilty.”—“Now, aunt, we mustn’t speak another word
till the opera is through, because we disturb the people.”—“I suppose
we do; but, whenever any thing happens, you nudge me, and I’ll nudge
you; or we can squeeze hands,—that’s the way Peleg and I do when we go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38a" id="Page_38a">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to the lyceum. It’s sorter social, and everybody can hear just as
well.” Soon outrang the glorious voice. “Bravo! bravo! bravo!”
echoed from all parts of the house “Hooray!”—“Why, Aunt Tabor! sit
down.”—“If Peleg were only here! Hip, hip”—“Aunt, in pity’s name
keep still! Don’t get so excited.”—“Well, I never! The sweat’s just
a-rolling off me, and I am as weak as a rag-baby. I wish I had my
turkey-tail. This mite of a fan of yours don’t give wind enough to cool
a mouse.”—“Now, aunt, do keep quiet. You’ll hear better, and won’t
get so warm.”—“Well, dear, I suppose you are right. But didn’t that
sound like an angel-choir?”—“’Twas certainly very fine. One thing is
sure: you’ve heard Patti at her best.”—“I’m so glad I came; and if
Peleg was only along! But, there, I hain’t going to speak again till
the uproar is over.” And so the opera went on, when, suddenly: “Louisa
Allen, what are them half-nude statutes a-standing up in the back
there? Don’t they realize that the whole congregation can see them?
and haven’t they any modesty?”—“Why, aunt, that’s the ballet.”—“The
what?”—“The ballet, aunt. Look, look! there they come. Isn’t that the
very poetry of”—“Louisa Sophronia Tabor Allen, just you pick up your
regimentals, and follow me; and that quick, too.”—“But, auntie”—“You
needn’t auntie me. Just get your duds together, and we’ll travel. Thank
goodness your uncle Peleg Josiah Tabor is not here! Don’t let me see
you give as much as a glance to where those graceless nudities are,
or, big as you are, I’ll box your ears.”—“Why, aunt”—“Louisa, I only
wish I had my thickest veil, for I am positively ashamed to be caught
in this unchristian scrape. Come, and don’t raise your eyes. There,
thank goodness, we’re in pure air at last!”—“Why, aunt, I thought
you were enjoying the opera!”—“The uproar, Louisa? I have nothing to
say agin the uproar. Them voices would grace a celestial choir. This
I say with all reverence. But that side show! I wouldn’t have had my
Eliza Ann, nor my Woodman Harrison, ’a’ witnessed what we’ve come near
a-witnessing for a thousand-dollar bill. No, not for a ten-thousand
bill. And I am so thankful that your uncle Peleg was not here! Somehow,
Louisa, I feel as if I’d fallen like the blessed Lucifer out of the moon.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="TROUT" id="TROUT"></a>A FIGHT WITH A TROUT.</h3></div>

<p>We had been hearing for weeks of a small lake in the heart of
the forest, some ten miles from our camp, which was alive with
trout,—unsophisticated, hungry trout: the inlet to it was described
as stiff with them. In my imagination I saw them lying there in ranks
and rows, each a foot long, three tiers deep, a solid mass. The lake
had never been visited, except by stray sable hunters in the winter,
and was known as Unknown Pond. I determined to explore it fully,
expecting that it would prove to be a delusion, as such haunts of the
trout usually are. Confiding my purpose to Luke, we secretly made our
preparations, and stole away from the shanty one morning at daybreak.
Each of us carried a boat, a pair of blankets, a sack of bread, pork,
and maple sugar; while I had my case of rods, reel, and book of flies,
and Luke had an axe and the kitchen utensils. We think nothing of loads
of this kind in the woods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A couple of hours before sundown we reached the lake. If I live, to
my dying day I shall never forget its appearance.... But what chiefly
attracted my attention, and amused me, was the boiling of the water,
the bubbling and breaking, as if the lake were a vast kettle with
fire underneath. A tyro would have been astonished at this common
phenomenon; but sportsmen will at once understand me, when I say that
the water <i>boiled</i> with the breaking trout. I began casting, and had
got out perhaps fifty feet of line, and gradually increased it to a
hundred. It is not difficult to learn to cast, but it is difficult to
learn not to jerk off the flies at every throw. Finally, in making a
shorter cast, I saw a splash where the leader fell, and gave an excited
jerk. The next instant I perceived the game, and did not need the
unfeigned “dam” of Luke to convince me that I had snatched his felt hat
from his head, and deposited it among the lilies. Discouraged by this,
we whirled about, and paddled over to the inlet, where a little ripple
was visible in the tinted light. Instantly, upon casting, there was a
rush, a swirl. I struck, and “Got him, by—” Never mind what Luke said
I got him by. “Out on a fly,” continued that irreverent guide; but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41a" id="Page_41a">[Pg 41]</a></span>
told him to back water, and make for the centre of the lake. The trout,
as soon as he felt the prick of the hook, was off like a shot, and took
out the whole of the line with a rapidity that made it smoke. “Give him
the butt,” shouted Luke. It is the usual remark in such an emergency.
I gave him the butt; and, recognizing the fact and my spirit, the
trout sank to the bottom, and sulked. It is the most dangerous mood
of the trout, for you cannot tell what he will do next. We reeled up
a little, and waited five minutes for him to reflect. A tightening of
the line enraged him, and he soon developed his tactics. Coming to the
surface, he made straight for the boat faster than I could reel in, and
evidently with hostile intentions.</p>

<p>“Look out for him!” cried Luke, as he came flying in the air. I evaded
him by dropping flat in the bottom of the boat; and when I picked my
traps up he was spinning across the lake as if he had a new idea,
but the line was still fast. He did not run far. I gave him the butt
again, a thing he seemed to hate, even as a gift. In a moment the
evil-minded fish, lashing the water in his rage, was coming back
again, making straight for the boat as before. Luke, who was used to
these encounters, having read them in the writings of travellers he
had accompanied, raised his paddle in self-defence. The trout left the
water about ten feet from the boat, and came directly at me with fiery
eyes, his speckled sides flashing like a meteor. I dodged as he whisked
by with a vicious slap of his bifurcated tail, and nearly upset the
boat. The line was, of course, slack: and the danger was, that he would
entangle it about me, and carry away one leg. This was evidently his
game: but I untangled it, and only lost a breast-button or two by the
swift-moving string. The trout plunged into the water with a hissing
sound, and went away again with all the line on the reel. More butt,
more indignation on the part of the captive. The contest had now been
going on for half an hour, and I was getting exhausted. We had been
back and forth across the lake, and around and around the lake. What
I feared was, that the trout would start up the inlet, and wreck us
in the bushes. But he had a new fancy, and began the execution of a
manœuvre which I had never read of. Instead of coming straight toward
us, he took a large circle, swimming rapidly, and gradually contracting
his orbit. I reeled in, and kept my eye on him. Round and round he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42a" id="Page_42a">[Pg 42]</a></span>
went, narrowing the circle. I began to suspect the game, which was to
twist my head off. When he had reduced the radius of his circle to
about twenty-five feet, he struck a tremendous pace through the water.
It would be false modesty in a sportsman to say that I was not equal
to the occasion. Instead of turning around with him, as he expected, I
stepped to the bow, braced myself, and let the boat swing. Round went
the fish, and round we went like a top. I saw a line of Mount Marcys
all around the horizon; the rosy tint of the west made a broad bank of
pink along the sky above the tree-tops; the evening star was a perfect
circle of light, a hoop of gold in the heavens. We whirled and reeled,
and reeled and whirled. I was willing to give the malicious beast butt
and line and all, if he would only go the other way for a change.</p>

<p>When I came to myself, Luke was gaffing the trout at the boat-side.
After we had got him in and dressed him, he weighed three-quarters of
a pound! Fish always lose by being “got in and dressed.” It is best
to weigh them while they are in the water. The only really large one
I ever caught, got away with my leader when I first struck him. He
weighed ten pounds.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="FORCIBLE_ENTRY" id="FORCIBLE_ENTRY"></a>FORCIBLE ENTRY.</h3></div>

<p>It happened out on South Hill, nine thousand miles from Maple Street.
The man’s wife had taken up the carpet in the bath-room the day before,
and put all the crooked tacks in a saucer, and put it on a chair.
It is a marvellous thing why women will always save tacks that come
out of the carpet; although it is a matter of record, that, out of
the countless millions of tacks thus laid by, not one was ever used
again, save in the soles of the bare masculine feet. They—the tacks,
not the feet—are stowed away in saucers up on high shelves, in dark
closets, and in all sorts of out-of-the-way places. And on these dusty
perches they remain until the corroding hand of time, and dust, and
spider-webs, and dead flies, and flakes of whitewash, and old bits
of resin, and chunks of sealing-wax, and old steel pens, and similar
accumulations, have filled the saucer to overflowing, when it is taken
down and thrown away by the woman, who petulantly wonders who under
the sun put all that trash in the saucer, and stuck it up there. And
nine times out of ten she charges the crime on her husband. The tenth
time she declares it was the hired girl. And always, before the saucer
of crooked tacks is stowed away on the shelf, it is stuck around for
three or four days on chairs and in corners of the room, spilling out
occasional tacks on the carpet of every bedroom in the house, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46a" id="Page_46a">[Pg 46]</a></span>
fill the masculine soles with agony, and darken the air of the bedroom
with inartistic but forcible profanity. Nothing is so painful as a
crooked tack in the middle of one’s foot. A broken heart doesn’t hold
half so much anguish, and a boil is a blessing in comparison.</p>

<p>This man who lives so far from Maple Street had a splendid bath; and
when he had rubbed his skin into a glow with a crash-towel as rough as
a pig’s back, he gathered his socks, and, backing up to the only chair
in the room, sat down to put them on.</p>

<p>Every tack in that saucer saw him coming down.</p>

<p>Every last tack smiled in anticipation of the <i>dénoûment</i>, and
stood on its head, and reached for him.</p>

<p>Every last solitary individual and collective tack fetched him, got
him, and held to him.</p>

<p>He dropped his socks, and rose from that chair with an abruptness that
knocked his head against the ceiling. He came down, and waltzed wildly
round and round the room, shrieking and yelling, gyrating madly with
his arms, while his eyes stuck out so far they hung down. He howled
until the neighbors besieged the house, yet he wouldn’t let any of
them in. At last his yells died away; but they could hear his breath
hiss between his set teeth, while at short intervals would come a
yell, supplemented by the remark, “There’s another out!” In about
three-quarters of an hour the yells ceased entirely, the window was
opened, and a shower of tacks fell over the assembled and wondering
multitude; while a large saucer skimmed across the street, and smashed
against the side of a house opposite.</p>

<p>Nobody knows what ails the man, for he will not tell any one a thing
about it: but he takes his meals off the mantel-piece all the same;
and, when he sits, he sits down on his hip, for all the world as though
he wore a “tied-back.” But he doesn’t. It’s a tacked-back that ails him.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="W_PHILLIPS" id="W_PHILLIPS"></a>WENDELL PHILLIPS.</h3></div>

<p>The power to discern right amid all the wrappings of interest, and all
the seductions of ambition, was singularly his. To choose the lowly;
for their sake to abandon all favor, all power, all comfort, all
ambition, all greatness,—that was his genius and glory. He confronted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47a" id="Page_47a">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the spirit of the nation and of the age. I had almost said, he set
himself against nature, as if he had been a decree of God overriding
all these other insuperable obstacles. That was his function. Mr.
Phillips was not called to be a universal orator, any more than he was
a universal thinker. In literature and in history he was widely read;
in person most elegant; in manners most accomplished; gentle as a babe;
sweet as a new-blown rose; in voice, clear and silvery. He was not a
man of tempests; he was not an orchestra of a hundred instruments;
he was not an organ, mighty and complex. The nation slept, and God
wanted a trumpet, sharp, far-sounding, narrow, and intense; and that
was Mr. Phillips. The long roll is not particularly agreeable in music
or in times of peace; but it is better than flutes or harps when men
are in a great battle, or are on the point of it. His eloquence was
penetrating and alarming. He did not flow as a mighty gulf-stream: he
did not dash upon the continent as the ocean does; he was not a mighty
rushing river. His eloquence was a flight of arrows, sentence after
sentence, polished, and most of them burning. He shot them one after
the other, and where they struck they slew; always elegant, always
awful. I think scorn in him was as fine as I ever knew it in any human
being. He had that sublime sanctuary in his pride that made him almost
insensitive to what would by other men be considered obloquy. It was as
if he said every day, in himself, “I am not what they are firing at. I
am not there, and I am not that. It is not against me. I am infinitely
superior to what they think me to be. They do not know me.” It was
quiet and unpretentious, but it was there. Conscience and pride were
the two concurrent elements of his nature.</p>

<p>He lived to see the slave emancipated, but not by moral means. He lived
to see the sword cut the fetter. After this had taken place, he was
too young to retire, though too old to gather laurels of literature,
or to seek professional honors. The impulse of humanity was not at all
abated. His soul still flowed on for the great under-masses of mankind;
though, like the Nile, it split up into diverse mouths, and not all of
them were navigable.</p>

<p>After a long and stormy life, his sun went down in glory. All the
English-speaking people on the globe have written among the names that
shall never die, the name of that scoffed, detested, mob-beaten Wendell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48a" id="Page_48a">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Phillips. Boston, that persecuted and would have slain him, is now
exceedingly busy in building his tomb, and rearing his statue. The men
that would not defile their lips with his name are to-day thanking God
that he lived.</p>

<p>He has taught a lesson that the young will do well to take heed
to,—the lesson that the most splendid gifts and opportunities and
ambitions may be best used for the dumb and the lowly. His whole life
is a rebuke to the idea that we are to climb to greatness by climbing
up on the backs of great men; that we are to gain strength by running
with the currents of life; that we can from without add any thing to
the great within that constitutes man. He poured out the precious
ointment of his soul upon the feet of that diffusive Jesus who suffers
here in his poor and despised ones. He has taught the young ambitions,
too, that the way to glory is the way, oftentimes, of adhesion simply
to principle: and that popularity and unpopularity are not things to be
known or considered. Do right and rejoice. If to do right will bring
you into trouble, rejoice that you are counted worthy to suffer with
God and the providences of God in this world.</p>

<p>He belongs to the race of giants, not simply because he was in and of
himself a great soul, but because he bathed in the providence of God,
and came forth scarcely less than a god; because he gave himself to the
work of God upon earth, and inherited thereby, or had reflected upon
him, some of the majesty of his Master. When pygmies are all dead, the
noble countenance of Wendell Phillips will still look forth, radiant
as a rising sun,—a sun that will never set. He has become to us a
lesson, his death an example, his whole history an encouragement to
manhood,—to heroic manhood.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="AUNT_PARSONS" id="AUNT_PARSONS"></a>AUNT PARSONS’S STORY.</h3></div>

<p>I told Hezekiah—that’s my man. People mostly call him Deacon Parsons,
but he never gets any deaconing from me. We were married—“Hezekiah and
Amariah”—that’s going on forty years ago, and he’s jest Hezekiah to
me, and nothin’ more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49a" id="Page_49a">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, as I was saying, says I, “Hezekiah, we aren’t right. I am sure of
it.” And he said, “Of course not. We are poor sinners, Amy; all poor
sinners.” And I said, “Hezekiah, this ‘poor-sinner’ talk has gone on
long enough. I suppose we are poor sinners, but I don’t see any use of
being <i>mean</i> sinners; and there’s one thing I think is real mean.”</p>

<p>It was jest after breakfast: and, as he felt poorly, he hedn’t gone to
the shop yet; and so I had this little talk with him to sort o’ chirk
him up. He knew what I was comin’ to, for we hed had the subject up
before. It was our little church. He always said, “The poor people, and
what should we ever do?” And I always said, “We never shall do nothin’
unless we try.” And so, when I brought the matter up in this way,
he just began bitin’ his toothpick, and said, “What’s up now? Who’s
mean? Amariah, we oughtn’t to speak evil one of another.” Hezekiah
always says “poor sinners,” and doesn’t seem to mind it; but when I
occasionally say “mean sinners,” he somehow gits oneasy. But I was
started, and I meant to free my mind.</p>

<p>So I said, says I, “I was goin’ to confess our sins. Dan’l confessed
for all his people, and I was confessin’ for all our little church.</p>

<p>“Truth is,” says I, “ours is allus called one of the ‘feeble churches,’
and I am tried about it. I’ve raised seven children, and at fourteen
months old every boy and girl of ’em could run alone. And our church
is fourteen years old,” says I; “and it can’t take a step yet without
somebody to hold on by. The Board helps us; and General Jones, good
man, he helps us,—helps too much, I think,—and so we live along; but
we don’t seem to get strong. Our people draw their rations every year
as the Indians do up at the agency, and it doesn’t seem sometimes as if
they ever thought of doing any thing else.</p>

<p>“They take it so easy!” I said. “That’s what worries me. I don’t
suppose we could pay all expenses; but we might act as if we wanted to,
and as if we meant to do all we can.</p>

<p>“I read,” says I, “last week about the debt of the Board; and this
week, as I understand,” says I, “our application is going in for
another year, and no particular effort to do any better; and it frets
me. I can’t sleep nights, and I can’t take comfort Sundays. I’ve got to
feelin’ as if we were a kind of perpetual paupers. And that was what I
meant when I said, ‘It is real mean!’ I suppose I said it a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50a" id="Page_50a">[Pg 50]</a></span>
sharp,” says I, “but I’d rather be sharp than flat any day; and if we
don’t begin to stir ourselves, we shall be flat enough before long, and
shall deserve to be. It grows on me. It has jest been ‘Board, Board,
Board,’ for fourteen years, and I’m tired of it. I never did like
boardin’,” says I; “and even if we were poor, I believe we might do
something toward settin’ up housekeepin’ for ourselves.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s not many of us—about a hundred, I believe; and some of
these is women-folks, and some is jest girls and boys. And we all have
to work hard, and live close; but,” says I, “let us show a disposition,
if nothing more. Hezekiah, if there’s any spirit left in us, let us
show some sort of a disposition.”</p>

<p>And Hezekiah had his toothpick in his teeth, and looked down at his
boots, and rubbed his chin, as he always does when he’s goin’ to say
somethin’. “I think there’s some of us that shows a disposition.”</p>

<p>Of course I understood that hit, but I kep’ still. I kep’ right on with
my argument; and I said, “Yes, and a pretty bad disposition it is. It’s
a disposition to let ourselves be helped when we ought to be helping
ourselves. It’s a disposition to lie still and let somebody carry us.
And we are growing up cripples—only we don’t grow.</p>

<p>“’Kiah,” says I, “do you hear me?” Sometimes when I want to talk a
little he jest shets his eyes, and begins to rock himself back and
forth in the old arm-chair; and he was doin’ that now. So I said,
“’Kiah, do you hear?” And he said, “Some!” and I went on. “I’ve got a
proposition,” says I. And he sort o’ looked up, and said, “Hev you?
Well, between a disposition and a proposition, I guess the proposition
might be better.”</p>

<p>He’s awful sarcrostic, sometimes. But I wasn’t goin’ to get riled,
nor thrown off the track; so I jest said, “Yes; do you and I git two
shillin’s’ worth apiece, a week, out o’ that blessed little church
of ourn, do you think?” says I. “Cos, if we do, I want to give two
shillin’s a week to keep it goin’; and I thought maybe you could do as
much.” So he said he guessed we could stand that; and I said, “That’s
my proposition, and I mean to see if we can’t find somebody else
that’ll do the same. It’ll show disposition, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you’ll hev your own way,” says he: “you most always
do.” And I said, “Isn’t it most allers a good way?” Then I brought out
my subscription paper. I had it all ready. I didn’t jest know how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51a" id="Page_51a">[Pg 51]</a></span>
shape it, but I knew it was something about “the sums set opposite our
names;” and so I drawed it up, and took my chances. “You must head
it,” says I, “because you’re the oldest deacon; and I must go on next,
because I am the deacon’s wife; and then I’ll see some of the rest of
the folks.”</p>

<p>So ’Kiah sot down, and put on his specs, and took his pen, but did not
write. “What’s the matter?” says I. And he said, “I’m sort o’ ’shamed
to subscribe two shillin’s. I never signed so little as that for any
thing. I used to give that to the circus when I was nothin’ but a boy,
and I ought to do more than that to support the gospel. Two shillin’ a
week! Why, it’s only a shillin’ a sermon, and all the prayer-meetin’s
throwed in. I can’t go less than fifty cents, I am sure.” So down he
went for fifty cents; and then I signed for a quarter, and then my
sunbonnet went onto my head pretty lively; and says I, “Hezekiah,
there’s some cold potato in the pantry, and you know where to find
the salt; so, if I am not back by dinner-time, don’t be bashful, help
yourself.” And I started.</p>

<p>I called on the Smith family first. I felt sure of them. And they were
just happy. Mr. Smith signed, and so did Mrs. Smith; and Long John,
he came in while we were talkin’, and put his name down; and then
old Grandma Smith, she didn’t want to be left out; so there was four
of ’em. I’ve allers found it a great thing in any good enterprise to
enlist the Smith family. There’s a good many of ’em. Next, I called on
the Joslyns, and next on the Chapins, and then on the Widdy Chadwick,
and so I kept on.</p>

<p>I met a little trouble once or twice, but not much. There was Fussy
Furber; and bein’ trustee, he thought I was out of my spear, he said;
and he wanted it understood that such work belonged to the trustees.
“To be sure,” says I: “I’m glad I’ve found it out. I wish the trustees
had discovered that a leetle sooner.” Then there was sister Puffy
that’s got the asthma. She thought we ought to be lookin’ after “the
sperritooalities.” She said we must get down before the Lord. She
didn’t think churches could be run on money. But I told her I guessed
we should be jest as spiritual to look into our pocketbooks a little,
and I said it was a shame to be ’tarnally beggin’ so of the Board.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52a" id="Page_52a">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked dredful solemn when I said that, and I almost felt as I’d
been committin’ profane language. But I hope the Lord will forgive me
if I took any thing in vain. I did not take my call in vain, I tell
you. Mrs. Puffy is good, only she allus wanted to talk so pious; and
she put down her two shillin’s, and then hove a sigh. Then I found the
boys at the cooper-shop, and got seven names there at one lick; and
when the list began to grow, people seemed ashamed to say no; and I
kept gainin’ till I had jest an even hundred, and then I went home.</p>

<p>Well, it was pretty well towards candle-light when I got back, and I
was that tired I didn’t know much of any thing. I’ve washed, and I’ve
scrubbed, and I’ve baked, and I’ve cleaned house, and I’ve biled soap,
and I’ve moved; and I ’low that a’most any one of that sort of thing
is a little exhaustin’. But put your bakin’ and movin’ and bilin’ soap
all together, and it won’t work out as much genuine tired soul and
body as one day with a subscription paper to support the gospel. So
when I sort o’ dropped into a chair, and Hezekiah said, “Well?” I was
past speakin’; and I put my check apron up to my face as I hadn’t done
since I was a young, foolish girl, and cried. I don’t know what I felt
so bad about: I don’t know as I did feel bad. But I felt cry, and I
cried. And ’Kiah, seein’ how it was, felt kind o’ sorry for me, and set
some tea a-steepin’; and when I had had my drink with weepin’, I felt
better. I handed him the subscription paper, and he looked it over as
if he didn’t expect any thing; but soon he began saying, “I never! I
never!” And I said, “Of course you didn’t: you never tried. How much is
it?”—“Why, don’t you know?” says he. “No,” I said: “I ain’t quick in
figures, and I hadn’t time to foot it up. I hope it will make us out
this year three hundred dollars or so.”</p>

<p>“Amy,” says he, “you’re a prodigy—a prodigal, I may say—and you don’t
know it. A hundred names at two shillin’ each gives us twenty-five
dollars a Sunday. Some of ’em may fail, but most of ’em is good; and
there is ten, eleven, thirteen, that sign fifty cents. That’ll make up
what fails. That paper of yourn’ll give us thirteen hundred dollars a
year!” I jumped up like I was shot. “Yes,” he says, “we sha’n’t need
any thing this year from the Board. <i>This church</i>, for this year at any
rate, is <i>self-supporting</i>.”</p>

<p>We both sot down and kep’ still a minute, when I said kind o’ softly,
“Hezekiah,” says I, “isn’t it about time for prayers?” I was just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53a" id="Page_53a">[Pg 53]</a></span>
chokin’; but, as he took down the Bible, he said, “I guess we’d had
better sing somethin’.” I nodded like, and he just struck in. We often
sing at prayers in the morning; but now it seemed like the Scripter
that says, “He giveth songs in the night.” ’Kiah generally likes the
solemn tunes, too; and we sing “Show pity, Lord,” a great deal; and
this mornin’ we had sung “Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound,” ’cause
’Kiah was not feelin’ very well, and we wanted to chirk up a little.</p>

<p>So I just waited to see what metre he’d strike to-night; and would
you believe it? I didn’t know that he knew any sech tune. But off he
started on “Joy to the world, the Lord is come.” I tried to catch on;
but he went off lickerty-switch, like a steam-engine, and I couldn’t
keep up. I was partly laughin’ to see ’Kiah go it, and partly crying
again, my heart was so full; so I doubled up some of the notes, and
jumped over the others; and so we safely reached the end.</p>

<p>But, I tell you, Hezekiah prayed. He allers prays well; but this was
a bran’ new prayer, exactly suited to the occasion. And when Sunday
come, and the minister got up and told what had been done, and said,
“It is all the work of one good woman, and done in one day,” I just got
scared, and wanted to run. And when some of the folks shook hands with

church; and all that, I came awful nigh gettin’ proud. But, as Hezekiah
says, “we’re all poor sinners;” and so I choked it back. But I am glad
I did it; and I don’t believe our church will ever go boarding any more.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="HOWL_ROME" id="HOWL_ROME"></a>A HOWL IN ROME.</h3></div>

<p>It had been a day of triumph in Capua. Lentulus, returning with
victorious eagles, had amused the populace with the sports of the
amphitheatre to an extent hitherto unknown, even in that luxurious
city. A large number of people from the rural districts had taken
advantage of half-rates on the railroad, and had been in town watching
the conflict in the arena, listening to the infirm, decrepit ring-joke,
and viewing the bogus sacred elephant.</p>

<p>The shouts of revelry had died away. The last loiterer had retired from
the free-lunch counter, and the lights in the palace of the victor were
extinguished. The restless hyena in the Roman menagerie had sunk to
rest, and the Numidian lion at the stock-yards had taken out his false
teeth for the night. The moon, piercing the tissue of fleecy clouds,
tipped the dark waters of the Tiber with a wavy, tremulous light. The
dark-browed Roman soldier moved on his homeward way, the sidewalk
flipping up occasionally, and hitting him in the small of the back. No
sound was heard, save the low sob of some retiring wave as it told its
story to the smooth pebbles on the beach, or the unrelenting boot-jack
as it struck the high board fence in the back yard, just missing the
Roman tomcat in its mad flight; and then all was still as the breast
when the spirit has departed. Anon the half-stifled Roman snore would
steal in upon its deathly stillness, and then die away like a hot
biscuit in the hands of the hired man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68a" id="Page_68a">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>In the green room of the amphitheatre a little band of gladiators were
assembled. The foam of conflict yet lingered on their lips, the scowl
of battle yet hung upon their brows, and the large knobs on their
profiles indicated that it had been a busy day with them in the arena.</p>

<p>There was an embarrassing silence of about five minutes, when
Spartacus, gently laying his chew of tobacco on the banister, stepped
forth and addressed them:—</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,—Ye call me chief, and ye do well
to call him chief who for twelve long years has met in the arena every
shape of man or beast that the broad empire of Rome could furnish, and
yet has never squealed. I do not say this egotistically, but simply to
show that I am the star thumper of the entire outfit.</p>

<p>“If there be one among you who can say that ever in public fight, or
private brawl, my actions did belie my words, let him stand forth and
say it, and I will spread him around over the arena till the coroner
will have to soak him out of the ground with benzine. If there be three
in all your company dare face me on the bloody sands, let them come,
and I will construct upon their physiognomy such cupolas and cornices
and dormer-windows and Corinthian capitals and entablatures, that
their own masters would pass them by in the broad light of high noon
unrecognized.</p>

<p>“And yet I was not always thus,—a hired butcher,—the savage chief of
still more savage men. My ancestors came from Sparta, Wisconsin, and
settled among the vine-clad hills and citron-groves of Syracuse. My
early life ran as quiet as the clear brook by which I sported. Aside
from the gentle patter of my angel mother’s slipper on the bustle of my
overalls, every thing moved along with the still and rhythmic flow of
goose-grease. My boyhood was one long, happy summer day. We stole the
Roman muskmelon, and put split sticks on the tail of the Roman dog, and
life was a picnic and a hallelujah.</p>

<p>“When, at noon, I led the sheep beneath the shade, and played ‘Little
Sallie Waters’ on my shepherd’s flute, there was another Spartan youth,
the son of a neighbor, to join me in the pastime; we led our flocks to
the same pasture, and together picked the large red ants out of our doughnuts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69a" id="Page_69a">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>“One evening, after the sheep had been driven into the corral, and we
were all seated beneath the ‘Bammygilead’-tree that shaded our cottage,
my grandsire, an old man, was telling of Marathon and Leuctra, and Dr.
Mary Walker, and other great men; and how a little band of Spartans at
Milwaukee had stood off the police, and how they fled away into the
mountains, and there successfully held an annual pass over the C. M. &amp;
St. P. Railway. Held it for a year! I did not know then what war was;
but my cheeks burned, I knew not why, and I thought what a glorious
thing it would be to leave the reservation, and go upon the war-path.
But my mother kissed my throbbing temples, and bade me go and soak
my head, and think no more of those old tales and savage wars. That
very night the Romans landed on our coasts. They pillaged the whole
country, burned the agency buildings, demolished the ranche, rode off
the stock, tore down the smoke-house, and ran their war horses over the
cucumber-vines.</p>

<p>“To-day I killed a man in the arena; and when I broke his helmet
clasps, and looked upon him, behold! he was my friend. The same sweet
smile was on his face that I had known when in adventurous boyhood we
bathed in the glassy lake by our Spartan home, and he had tied my shirt
into 1,752 dangerous and difficult knots. He knew me, smiled faintly,
told me always to tell the truth, and to travel by the Milwaukee &amp; St.
Paul road, and then ascended the golden stair. I begged of the Praetor
that I might be allowed to bear away the body, and have it packed in
ice, and shipped to his relatives in Sparta, Wisconsin; but he couldn’t
see it. As upon my bended knees, amid the dust and blood of the arena,
I begged this poor boon, and the Praetor answered, ‘Let the carrion
rot. There are no noblemen but Romans and Ohio men. Let the show go on.
Bring forth the bobtail lion from Abbyssinia.’ And the assembled maids
and matrons and the rabble shouted in derision, and told me to ‘brace
up;’ and they threw peanut-shells at me, and told me to ‘cheese it,’
with other Roman flings which I do not now recall.</p>

<p>“And so must you, fellow gladiators, and so must I, die like dogs.
To-morrow we are billed to appear at the Coliseum at Rome; and
reserved seats are even now being sold for our moral and instructive
performance, while I am speaking to you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70a" id="Page_70a">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye stand here like giants as ye are; but to-morrow some Roman dude
will pat your red brawn, and bet his shekels upon your blood.</p>

<p>“O Rome! Rome! Thou hast been a tender nurse to me. Thou hast given to
that gentle, timid, shepherd lad, who never knew a harsher tone than a
flute note, muscles of iron, and a heart of steel. Thou hast taught him
to drive his sword through plaited mail and links of rugged brass, and
warm it in the stomach of his foe; to gaze into the glaring eyeballs
of a fierce Numidian lion, even as the smooth-cheeked senator looks
into the laughing eyes of the chambermaid. And he shall pay thee back
till the rushing Tiber is red as frothing wine, and in its deepest ooze
thy life-blood lies curdled. Ye doubtless hear the gentle murmur of my bazoo.</p>

<p>“Hark! Hear ye yon lion roaring in his den? ’Tis three days since he
tasted flesh, but to-morrow he will have gladiator on toast, and don’t
you forget it; and he will fling your vertebræ around his cage, and
wipe his nose on your clustering hair.</p>

<p>“If ye are brutes, then stand here like fat oxen waiting the butcher’s
knife. If ye are men, arise and follow me! Strike down the warden
and the turnkey, slide our baggage out the third story window of the
amphitheatre, overpower the public, and cut for the tall timber!</p>

<p>“O comrades! Warriors! Gladiators! If we be men, let us die like men,
beneath the blue sky, and by the still waters, and be buried according
to Hoyle, instead of having our shin-bones polished off by Numidian
lions, amid the groans and hisses of the populace here in Rome, New
York. Let us break loose, chaw the ear of the night watchman, buy our
tickets via the Chicago, Milwaukee, &amp; St. Paul Railway, and go to
farming in Dakota! <i>Then</i> if the fierce Roman don’t like our style, he
knows our post-office address.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="BEDSTEAD" id="BEDSTEAD"></a>STORY OF A BEDSTEAD.</h3></div>

<p>It was night.</p>

<p>The boarding-house was wrapt in tenebrous gloom, faintly tinted with an
odor of kerosene.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74a" id="Page_74a">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there arose on the air a yell, followed by wild objurgations
and furious anathemas.</p>

<p>Then there was a clanking and rattling, as of an over-turned
picket-fence, and another yell with more anathemas. The fatted boarders
listened, and, ghostly clad, tip-toed along to Buffum’s room,—he of
Buffum &amp; Bird, second-hand furniture dealers. As they stood there,
there was a whiz, a grinding, a rattling and a bang, and more yells.
They consulted, and knocked on the door.</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>“Open it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>Convinced that Buffum was in his last agony, they knocked in the door
with a bedpost.</p>

<p>The sight was ghastly. Clasped between two sturdy, though slender,
frames of walnut, Buffum, pale as a ghost, was six feet up in the air.
He couldn’t move. He was caught like a bear in a log-trap.</p>

<p>“What on earth is it?” they said.</p>

<p>“Bedstead—combination. New patent I was tellin’ you about,” gasped
Buffum.</p>

<p>His story was simple, though tearful. He had brought it home that day;
and, after using it for a writing-desk, had opened it out and made
his bed. He was going peacefully to dream-land, when he rolled over
and accidentally touched a spring. The faithful invention immediately
became a double crib, and turned Buffum into a squalling wafer. Then
he struggled, and was reaching around for the spring, when the patent
bedstead thought it would show off some more, and straightened out,
and shot up in the air, and was a clothes-horse. Buffum said he
didn’t like to be clothes, and he would give the thing to anybody
that would get him out. They said they would try. They didn’t want
any such fire-extinguisher as that for their trouble, but they would
try. They inspected it cautiously. They walked all around it. Then the
commission-merchant laid his little finger on the top end of it. The
thing snorted and reared as if it had been shot, slapped over with a
bang, and became an extension-table for ten people. When they recovered
from the panic, they came back. They found the commission-merchant in
the corner trying to get breath enough to swear, while he rubbed his
shins. Buffum had disappeared, but they knew he had not gone far. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75a" id="Page_75a">[Pg 75]</a></span>
invention appeared to have taken a fancy to him, and incorporated him
into the firm, so to speak. He was down underneath, straddling one of
the legs, with his head jammed into the mattress. Nobody dared to touch
it. The landlady got a club and reached for its vital parts, but could
not find them. She hammered her breath away; and when she got through,
and dropped the club in despair, the thing spread out its arms with a
gasp and a rattle, turned over twice, and slapped itself into a bed
again, with Buffum peacefully among the sheets. He held his breath for
a minute; and then, watching his opportunity, made a flying-leap to the
floor, just in time to save himself from being a folding-screen.</p>

<p>A man with a black eye and cut lip told the “Wasp” editor about it
yesterday. He said he owned the patent, that Buffum had been explaining
to him how it worked.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="GRANTS_STRATEGY" id="GRANTS_STRATEGY"></a>GRANT’S STRATEGY.</h3></div>

<p>Who had thought, until Grant said it, that the crisis comes in battle
when both armies are nearly exhausted, and that usually the one wins
which attacks first? When did he ever fail to attack first? Who had
thought, until he suggested it, that the trouble with the Potomac
army, the pride of the nation, was, that it had not fought its battles
through? Who then living has forgotten the utter downfall of hope, the
absolute despair throughout the North, as the moan from the Wilderness
came rolling up on the southern breeze? Is the task hopeless? Is this
last mighty effort only more disastrous than that of McClellan, of
Pope, of Burnside, of Hooker? No! listen to the assurance, “I’ll fight
it out on this line if it takes all summer.” Every loyal heart in the land
is inspired. That telegram to the President was the death-knell of rebellion.</p>

<p>But the test-hour of Grant had not yet come. Meade was glorious,
Sherman magnificent; but Sigel is routed, Butler has not succeeded,
Banks utterly failed. Shall Grant unloose his grip? Never! Was it,
then, less than the inspiration of genius? Sheridan, take the Sixth
Corps, and clean out the valley so a “crow must take his rations when
he flies over it.” Meade, absorb the army of the James, and never let
Lee escape. Sherman, march to the sea as a cyclone of devastation.
Thomas, play with Hood until you draw him to destruction. Stoneman,
take your bold riders across the mountains, into Virginia and the
Carolinas, right across every line of supply to the enemy. Wilson, push
your twelve thousand mounted men into the heart of Alabama. Canby,
capture Mobile.</p>

<p>Such was the new combination, audacious in strategy beyond precedent;
but, if faulty in any respect, military critics have not discovered
it. Its perfection, and the result of the execution, stamp it forever
with the insignia of genius. Masterly tactics, brilliant manœuvring,
bold fighting, though essential to success after the combinations have
produced the strategical situation, yet rarely cure material defect in
the latter. If cured at all, it is generally by blunders of the enemy.
Lee and Johnston, as defensive generals, were not blunderers. I pity
the man who, in the face of the record, attacks General Grant as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86a" id="Page_86a">[Pg 86]</a></span>
master of grand strategy. I need not speak of his tactics. I believe
mankind are agreed, that the history of war discloses no display of
tactical skill and vigor superior to Grant’s about Vicksburg, and from
the 3d to the 9th of April, 1865, being directed to prevent General
Lee’s attempted escape from Petersburg and junction with Johnston in
North Carolina. The annals of other wars seem tame when read by the
side of the story of that week’s work. It resulted in the despatch
to Secretary Stanton, so simple and modest in language, yet the most
momentous of all history: “General Lee surrendered the army of Northern
Virginia this afternoon on terms proposed by myself.” The work was
done, and how completely done,—done precisely as planned; not an
element, not a vestige, of luck in it. Every army was at the precise
place designed, with the exact work accomplished that was marked out
for it. Method, plan, design, exclude the idea of luck. Let us in
humble reverence say, as the truth was, the God of nations blessed
General Grant in his awful undertaking.</p>

<span class="i0">At last I saw it, and eagerly flew</span>
<span class="i0">To welcome my boy so manly and true.</span>
<span class="i0">But, alas! he was gone: no son to greet</span>
<span class="i0">My waiting heart came with eager feet.</span>
<span class="i0">But they told me there,—one stormy night,</span>
<span class="i0">When the heavens were filled with angry light,</span>
<span class="i0">The waves rolled high, and the winds beat wild,</span>
<span class="i0">That out on a frail yard went my child;</span>
<span class="i0">He had drunk deep, and ’twas fearful to sweep</span>
<span class="i0">On that slender spar o’er the seething deep;</span>
<span class="i0">That one heavy sea tossed the ship like a toy,</span>
<span class="i0">And hurled from his hold my darling boy.</span>
<span class="i0">Then I sank me down in agony wild,</span>
<span class="i0">And glared on the waves that rolled over my child:</span>
<span class="i0">I gazed until in the waters blue</span>
<span class="i0">I saw reflected the brilliant hue</span>
<span class="i0">Of one lone star, which, high above,</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to speak to my heart of faith and love;</span>
<span class="i0">And I thought, as I turned my eyes to its light,</span>
<span class="i0">It beckoned me on to the heavens so bright,</span>
<span class="i0">Where I know, whenever this life shall cease,</span>
<span class="i0">I shall meet my boy in eternal peace.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I had but one left; and him I taught</span>
<span class="i0">To shun each sinful word and thought;</span>
<span class="i0">To beware of the wine-cup’s demon lure,</span>
<span class="i0">That would steel his heart, and his soul obscure.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92a" id="Page_92a">[Pg 92]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He took the way of life that leads</span>
<span class="i0">To the sacred desk where the preacher pleads,</span>
<span class="i0">And placed his foot on the pulpit stair,</span>
<span class="i0">The gospel—banner of life—to bear.</span>
<span class="i0">When the cannon’s boom o’er Sumter broke,</span>
<span class="i0">And the air was filled with traitorous smoke;</span>
<span class="i0">When brave men sprang with willing hearts</span>
<span class="i0">To their Country’s flag to repel the darts</span>
<span class="i0">Which treason had hurled with malice wild</span>
<span class="i0">At the life of the mother, so good and mild,—</span>
<span class="i0">My boy stepped down from the preacher’s stand,</span>
<span class="i0">And started forth, with life in hand,</span>
<span class="i0">To sell it dear, but to battle strong</span>
<span class="i0">With the loyal North against fearful wrong.</span>
<span class="i0">I know that he carries a magic spell</span>
<span class="i0">’Gainst the curse of our race to guard him well;</span>
<span class="i0">And I know, should he fall, his death will be</span>
<span class="i0">In the foremost ranks of loyalty.</span>
<span class="i0">And now, young men, an old man’s prayer:—</span>
<span class="i0">Leave the bright wine in your glasses there;</span>
<span class="i0">Shun its allurements; for in its deep red</span>
<span class="i0">Is the blood of its victims dying and dead.</span>
<span class="i0">Fill up your glasses, and pledge your friend</span>
<span class="i0">In the crystal stream that Heaven doth send.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With a lowly bow, and the same meek air,</span>
<span class="i0">He has passed the door, and adown the stair;</span>
<span class="i0">While those he has left to their leader turn</span>
<span class="i0">With downcast eyes, and cheeks that burn.</span>
<span class="i0">Silent he stands as his glass he takes,</span>
<span class="i0">When the guest of the evening the silence breaks.</span>
<span class="i0">“Friends of my boyhood, the old man’s prayer</span>
<span class="i0">Shall meet a response in the heart I wear.</span>
<span class="i0">I come to-night from a mother’s side:</span>
<span class="i0">She watches my life with a parent’s pride;</span>
<span class="i0">And I know ’tis the dearest wish of her heart,</span>
<span class="i0">In camp and in battle to keep me apart</span>
<span class="i0">From sin and temptation; unceasing will pray</span>
<span class="i0">Heaven’s blessing to guard on my perilous way.</span>
<span class="i0">And this pledge will I leave her,—never again</span>
<span class="i0">The wine-cup’s deadly poison to drain.</span>
<span class="i0">So, friends, let’s drink to our meeting again:</span>
<span class="i0">My drink is the water, free from all stain.”</span>

<span class="i0">He stood with his upraised glass, and the light</span>
<span class="i0">Full on his fair young brow beamed bright,—</span>
<span class="i0">That brow which an anxious mother would kiss</span>
<span class="i0">With a pure, deep feeling of heartfelt bliss;</span>
<span class="i0">And along the line of his comrades young,</span>
<span class="i0">To honor his toast, each hand upsprung:</span>

<span class="i0">The flag of their Country overhead,</span>

<p class="center">A STORY OF HOLLAND.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The good dame looked from her cottage</span>
<span class="i2">At the close of the pleasant day,</span>
<span class="i0">And cheerily called to her little son</span>
<span class="i2">Outside the door at play,—</span>
<span class="i0">“Come, Peter, come! I want you to go,</span>
<span class="i2">While there is light to see,</span>
<span class="i0">To the hut of the blind old man who lives</span>
<span class="i2">Across the dike, for me;</span>
<span class="i0">And take these cakes I made for him—</span>
<span class="i2">They are hot and smoking yet:</span>
<span class="i0">You have time enough to go and come</span>
<span class="i2">Before the sun is set.”</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94a" id="Page_94a">[Pg 94]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the good-wife turned to her labor,</span>
<span class="i2">Humming a simple song,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought of her husband, working hard</span>
<span class="i2">At the sluices all day long;</span>
<span class="i0">And set the turf a-blazing,</span>
<span class="i2">And brought the coarse black bread,</span>
<span class="i0">That he might find a fire at night,</span>
<span class="i2">And find the table spread.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Peter left the brother,</span>
<span class="i2">With whom all day he had played,</span>
<span class="i0">And the sister who had watched their sports</span>
<span class="i2">In the willow’s tender shade,</span>
<span class="i0">And told them they’d see him back before</span>
<span class="i2">They saw a star in sight,</span>
<span class="i0">Though he wouldn’t be afraid to go</span>
<span class="i2">In the very darkest night!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For he was a brave, bright fellow,</span>
<span class="i2">With eye and conscience clear;</span>
<span class="i0">He could do whatever a boy might do,</span>
<span class="i2">And he had not learned to fear.</span>
<span class="i0">Why, he wouldn’t have robbed a bird’s nest,</span>
<span class="i2">Nor brought a stork to harm,</span>
<span class="i0">Though never a law in Holland</span>
<span class="i2">Had stood to stay his arm!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, with his face all glowing,</span>
<span class="i2">And eyes as bright as the day</span>
<span class="i0">With the thoughts of his pleasant errand,</span>
<span class="i2">He trudged along the way;</span>
<span class="i0">And soon his joyous prattle</span>
<span class="i2">Made glad a lonesome place—</span>
<span class="i0">Alas! if only the blind old man</span>
<span class="i2">Could have seen that happy face!</span>
<span class="i0">Yet he somehow caught the brightness</span>
<span class="i2">Which his voice and presence lent,</span>
<span class="i0">And he felt the sunshine come and go</span>
<span class="i2">As Peter came and went.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, as the day was sinking,</span>
<span class="i2">And the winds began to rise,</span>
<span class="i0">The mother looked from her door again.</span>
<span class="i2">Shading her anxious eyes,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95a" id="Page_95a">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And saw the shadows deepen,</span>
<span class="i2">And birds to their homes come back,</span>
<span class="i0">But never a sign of Peter</span>
<span class="i2">Along the level track.</span>
<span class="i0">But she said, “He will come at morning,</span>
<span class="i2">So I need not fret or grieve;</span>
<span class="i0">Though it isn’t like my boy at all</span>
<span class="i2">To stay without my leave.”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But where was the child delaying?</span>
<span class="i2">On the homeward way was he,</span>
<span class="i0">And across the dike, while the sun was up</span>
<span class="i2">An hour above the sea.</span>
<span class="i0">He was stopping, now to gather flowers,</span>
<span class="i2">Now listening to the sound,</span>
<span class="i0">As the angry waters dashed themselves</span>
<span class="i2">Against their narrow bound.</span>
<span class="i0">“Ah! well for us,” said Peter;</span>
<span class="i2">“That the gates are good and strong,</span>
<span class="i0">And my father tends them carefully,</span>
<span class="i2">Or they would not hold you long!</span>
<span class="i0">You’re a wicked sea,” said Peter:</span>
<span class="i2">“I know why you fret and chafe;</span>
<span class="i0">You would like to spoil our lands and homes</span>
<span class="i2">But our sluices keep you safe!”</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But hark! Through the noise of waters</span>
<span class="i2">Comes a low, clear, trickling sound;</span>
<span class="i0">And the child’s face pales with terror,</span>
<span class="i2">And his blossoms drop to the ground.</span>
<span class="i0">He is up the bank in a moment,</span>
<span class="i2">And, stealing through the sand,</span>
<span class="i0">He sees a stream not yet so large</span>
<span class="i2">As his slender, childish hand.</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis a leak in the dike! He is but a boy,</span>
<span class="i2">Unused to fearful scenes;</span>
<span class="i0">But, young as he is, he has learned to know</span>
<span class="i2">The dreadful thing that means.</span>
<span class="i0">A leak in the dike! The stoutest heart</span>
<span class="i2">Grows faint that cry to hear,</span>
<span class="i0">And the bravest man in all the land</span>
<span class="i2">Turns white with mortal fear.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96a" id="Page_96a">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For he knows the smallest leak may grow</span>
<span class="i2">To a flood in a single night,</span>
<span class="i0">And he knows the strength of the cruel sea</span>
<span class="i2">When loosed in its angry might.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the boy! He has seen the danger,</span>
<span class="i2">And, shouting a wild alarm,</span>
<span class="i0">He forces back the weight of the sea</span>
<span class="i2">With the strength of his single arm.</span>
<span class="i0">He listens for the joyful sound</span>
<span class="i2">Of a footstep passing nigh,</span>
<span class="i0">And lays his ear to the ground, to catch</span>
<span class="i2">The answer to his cry.</span>
<span class="i0">And he hears the rough winds blowing,</span>
<span class="i2">And the waters rise and fall,</span>
<span class="i0">But never an answer comes to him,</span>
<span class="i2">Save the echo of his call.</span>
<span class="i0">He sees no hope, no succor;</span>
<span class="i2">His feeble voice is lost;</span>
<span class="i0">Yet what shall he do but watch and wait,</span>
<span class="i2">Though he perish at his post!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, faintly calling and crying</span>
<span class="i2">Till the sun is under the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Crying and moaning till the stars</span>
<span class="i2">Come out for company,</span>
<span class="i0">He thinks of his brother and sister,</span>
<span class="i2">Asleep in their safe warm bed;</span>
<span class="i0">He thinks of his father and mother,</span>
<span class="i2">Of himself as dying—and dead;</span>
<span class="i0">And of how, when the night is over,</span>
<span class="i2">They must come and find him at last:</span>
<span class="i0">But he never thinks he can leave the place</span>
<span class="i2">Where duty holds him fast.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The good dame in the cottage</span>
<span class="i2">Is up and astir with the light,</span>
<span class="i0">For the thought of her little Peter</span>
<span class="i2">Has been with her all night.</span>
<span class="i0">And now she watches the pathway,</span>
<span class="i2">As yestereve she had done;</span>
<span class="i0">But what does she see so strange and black</span>
<span class="i2">Against the rising sun?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97a" id="Page_97a">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her neighbors are bearing between them</span>
<span class="i2">Something straight to her door:</span>
<span class="i0">Her child is coming home, but not</span>
<span class="i2">As he ever came before!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He is dead!” she cries; “my darling!”</span>
<span class="i2">And the startled father hears,</span>
<span class="i0">And comes and looks the way she looks,</span>
<span class="i2">And fears the thing she fears:</span>
<span class="i0">Till a glad shout from the bearers</span>
<span class="i2">Thrills the stricken man and wife—</span>
<span class="i0">“Give thanks, for your son has saved our land,</span>
<span class="i2">And God has saved his life!”</span>
<span class="i0">So, there in the morning sunshine</span>
<span class="i2">They knelt about the boy;</span>
<span class="i0">And every head was bared and bent</span>
<span class="i2">In tearful, reverent joy.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Tis many a year since then; but still,</span>
<span class="i2">When the sea roars like a flood,</span>
<span class="i0">Their boys are taught what a boy can do</span>
<span class="i2">Who is brave and true and good.</span>
<span class="i0">For every man in that country</span>
<span class="i2">Takes his son by the hand,</span>
<span class="i0">And tells him of little Peter,</span>
<span class="i2">Whose courage saved the land.</span>
<span class="i0">They have many a valiant hero</span>
<span class="i2">Remembered through the years,</span>
<span class="i0">But never one whose name so oft</span>
<span class="i2">Is named with loving tears.</span>
<span class="i0">And his deed shall be sung by the cradle,</span>
<span class="i2">And told the child on the knee,</span>
<span class="i0">So long as the dikes of Holland</span>
<span class="i2">Divide the land from the sea!</span>

<p>She came tripping from the church-door, her face flushed by emotions
awakened by the just uttered discourse, and eyes bright with loving
expectation. He shivered on the curbstone, where for an hour he had
waited impatiently, with a burning heart fairly palpitating in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98a" id="Page_98a">[Pg 98]</a></span>
throat, and frozen fingers in his pockets. They linked arms, and
started for the residence of her parents. After a few moments’
hesitating, silence, he said, “Jane, we have known each other long. You
must know just how I feel. You must have seen that clear down at the
bottom—O Moses!”</p>

<p>He had slipped down on the ice with so much force that his spine was
driven up into his hat, and his hat was tipped over his nose; but she
was a tender-hearted girl; she did not laugh, but she carefully helped
him to his feet, and said,—</p>

<p>“You were saying, John, when you slipped, that the foundation—Oh,
goodness!”</p>

<p>She slipped herself that time, and saw little stars come down to dance
before her eyes; but he pulled her up in haste, and went on,—</p>

<p>“Yes; just as I said, clean down at the bottom of my heart is a fervent
love, on which I build my hopes. That love has helped me stand and
face—Thunder!”</p>

<p>He was down again, but scrambled up before she could stoop to help him;
and she said, breathlessly,—</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, John. You remember you just said a love which helped you
stand and face thunder. And that you founded your hopes on—This pesky ice!”</p>

<p>There she sat. John grasped the loose part of her sack, between the
shoulders, with one hand, and raised her to her feet, as one would lift
a kitten from a pail of water by the back of the neck. Then he said,
with increased earnestness,—</p>

<p>“Of course, darling; and I have longed for a opportunity to tell my
love, and to hear those sweet lips whisper—Whoop!”</p>

<p>Somehow John’s feet had slipped from under him, and he had come down
like a capital V with his head and feet pointing skyward. She twined
her taper fingers in his curling locks, and raised him to the stature
of a man, set his hat firmly over his eyes with both hands, and cried,
in breathless haste,—</p>

<p>“I understand! and let me assure you John, that if it is in my power
to lighten your cares, and make lighter your journey through life to—Jerusalem!”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99a" id="Page_99a">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>John stood alone, and said with breathless vehemence,—“O my precious!
and thus shall it be my lifelong pleasure to lift you from the rude
assaults of earth, and surround you with the loving atmosphere of—Texas!”</p>

<p>And there they both sat together. They had nearly reached the gate,
and, hand in hand, and with hearts overflowing with the bliss of young
love’s first confession, they crept along on their knees up to the
front steps, and were soon forgetful of their bumps on the softest
cushion of the parlor sofa.</p>

<p>I have often laughed at the way an Irish help we had at Barnstable once
fished me for a glass of whiskey. One morning he says to me, “Oh, yer
honor,” says he, “I had a great drame last night intirely! I dramed I
was in Rome, tho’ how I got there is more than I can tell: but there
I was, sure enough; and as in duty bound, what does I do but go and
see the Pope. Well, it was a long journey, and it was late when I got
there—too late for the likes of me; and when I got to the palace I
saw priests and bishops and cardinals, and all the great dignitaries
of the Church, a-coming out; and sais one of them to me, ‘How are ye,
Pat Moloney?’ sais he; ‘and that spalpeen yer father, bad luck to him!
how is he?’ It startled me to hear me own name so suddent, that it
came mighty nigh waking me up, it did. Sais I, ‘Your riverence, how in
the world did ye know that Pat Moloney was me name, let alone that of
me father?’—‘Why, ye blackguard!’ sais he, ‘I knew ye since ye was
knee-high to a goose, and I knew yer mother afore ye was born.’—‘It’s
good right yer honor has then to know me,’ sais I.—‘Bad manners
to ye!’ sais he; ‘what is it ye are afther doing here at this time
o’night?’—‘To see his Holiness, the Pope,’ sais I. ‘That’s right,’
sais he; ‘pass on, but leave yer impudence with yer hat and shoes at
the door.’ Well, I was shown into a mighty fine room where his Holiness
was, and down I went on me knees. ‘Rise up, Pat Moloney,’ sais his
Holiness; ‘ye’re a broth of a boy to come all the way from Ireland to
do yer duty to me; and it’s dutiful children ye are, every mother’s son
of ye. What will ye have to drink, Pat?’ (The greater a man is, the
more of a rael gintleman he is, yer honor, and the more condescending.)
‘What will ye have to drink, Pat?’ sais he. ‘A glass of whiskey, yer
Holiness,’ sais I, ‘if it’s all the same to ye.’—‘Shall it be hot, or
cold?’ sais he. ‘Hot,’ sais I, ‘if it’s all the same, and gives ye no
trouble.’—‘Hot it shall be,’ sais he; ‘but as I have dismissed all me
servants for the night, I’ll just step down below for the tay-kettle;’
and wid that he left the room, and was gone for a long time; and jist
as he came to the door again he knocked so loud the noise woke me up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107a" id="Page_107a">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and, be jabers! I missed me whiskey entirely! Bedad, if I had only
had the sense to say ‘Nate, yer Holiness,’ I’d a had me whiskey sure
enough, and never known it warn’t all true, instead of a drame.” I knew
what he wanted, so I poured him out a glass. “Won’t it do as well now,
Pat?” said I. “Indeed it will, yer honor,” says he, “and me drame will
come true, after all. I thought it would; for it was mighty nateral at
the time, all but the whiskey.”</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="COOKERY" id="COOKERY"></a>LESSONS IN COOKERY.</h3></div>

<p>Miss Cicely Jones is just home from boarding-school, and engaged to be
married; and, as she knows nothing about cooking or housework, is going
to take a few lessons in culinary art to fit her for the new station
in life which she is expected to adorn with housewifely grace. She
certainly makes a charming picture as she stands in the kitchen-door,
draped in a chintz apron prettily trimmed with bows of ribbon, her
bangs hidden under a Dolly-Varden cap, old kid gloves, while she
sways to and fro on her dainty French-kid heels, like some graceful
wind-blown flower.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” she lisped prettily, “please introduce me to your assistant.”</p>

<p>Whereupon, mamma says, “Bridget, this is your young lady, Miss Cicely,
who wants to learn the name and use of every thing in the kitchen,
and how to make cocoanut rusks and angels’ food, before she goes to
housekeeping for herself.”</p>

<p>Bridget gives a snort of disfavor; but, as she looks at the young lady,
relents, and says, “I’ll throy.”</p>

<p>“And now, Bridget dear,” says Miss Cicely, when they were alone, “tell
me every thing. You see, I don’t know any thing, except what they did
at school; and isn’t this old kitchen lovely? What makes this ceiling
such a beautiful bronze color, Bridget?”</p>

<p>“Shmoke,” answers Bridget shortly; “and me ould eyes are put out with
that same.”</p>

<p>“Shmoke—I must remember that; and, Bridget, what are those shiny
things on the wall?”</p>

<p>“Kivers?—tin kivers for pots and kittles.”</p>

<p>“Kivers?—oh, yes; I must look for the derivation of that word.
Bridget, what are those round things in the basket?”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108a" id="Page_108a">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Praties! (For the Lord’s sake where hez ye lived niver to hear of
praties?) Why, them’s the principal mate of Ireland, where I kim from.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but we have corrupted the name into potatoes; such a shame not
to keep the idiom of a language! Bridget—do you mind if I call
you Biddie? It is more euphonious, and modernizes the old classic
appellation. What is this liquid in the pan here?”</p>

<p>“Och, murder! Where wuz ye raised? That’s millick, fresh from the cow.”</p>

<p>“Millick? That is the vernacular, I suppose, of milk; and that thick,
yellow coating?”</p>

<p>“Is crame. (Lord, such ignorance!)”</p>

<p>“Crame! Now, Biddie, dear, I must get to work. I’m going to make a cake
all out of my own head for Henry—he’s my lover, Biddie—to eat when he
comes to-night.”</p>

<p>Bridget [<i>aside</i>]: “It’s dead he is, sure, if he ates it!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it all down here, Biddie, on my tablet: A pound of butter,
twenty eggs, two pounds of sugar, salt to your taste. No, that’s a
mistake. Oh, here it is! Now, Biddie, the eggs first. It says to beat
them well; but won’t that break the shells?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d break thim this time if I were you, Miss Cicely; they might
not set well on Mister Henry’s stummack if ye didn’t,” said Bridget
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Oh! I suppose the shells are used separately. There! I’ve broken all
the eggs into the flour. I don’t think I’ll use the shells, Biddie;
give them to some poor people. Now, what next? Oh, I’m so tired! Isn’t
housework dreadful hard? But I’m glad I’ve learned to make cake. Now,
what shall I do next, Biddie?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Cicely, but you might give it to the pigs. It’s meself
can’t see any other use for it,” said Bridget, very crustily.</p>

<p>“Pigs! O Biddie! you don’t mean to say that you have some dear, cunning
little white pigs! Oh, do bring the little darlings in and let me feed
them! I’m just dying to have one for a pet! I saw some canton-flannel
ones once at a fair, and they were too awfully sweet for any thing.”</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang, and Bridget returned to announce Mr. Henry;
and Cicely told Bridget she would take another lesson the next day: and
then she went up-stairs in her chintz apron and mob-cap, with a little
dab of flour on her tip-lifted nose, and told Henry she was learning to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109a" id="Page_109a">[Pg 109]</a></span>
cook; and he told her she must not be overheated, or worried out, for
he didn’t care whether she could cook or not: he should never want to
eat when he could talk to her, and it was only sordid souls that cared
for cooking.</p>

<p>And, meanwhile, poor Bridget was just slamming things in the kitchen,
and talking to herself in her own sweet idiom about “idgits turning
things upside down for her inconvaniencing.”</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> “Thus far into the bowels of the land have we marched on
without impediment.” Here am I once more in the place from which, but
one short week ago, I made an unceremonious exit as the rejected suitor
of a young, lovely, and talented lady. Rejected suitor!—those words
slip very smoothly from the lips, as pleasantly as though they were
associated with some high-sounding title of nobility. There is nothing
in the sound of them to conjure up the miserable, mean, contemptible,
kicked-out feeling which a man experiences who has received at the
hands of lovely woman that specimen of feminine handicraft—the mitten.
All my own fault, too! I’m a bashful man. Modesty, the virtue which
is said to have been “the ruination of Ireland,” is the rock against
which my soaring ambition has dashed itself. I have sat in this room,
evening after evening, upon the edge of a chair, twirling my thumbs,
and saying—nothing. I couldn’t help it. I have brought scores of
compliments to the door, and left them in the hall with my hat. I
wanted to speak; I kept up “a deuce of a thinking;” but somehow, when I
had an agreeable speech ready to pop out of my mouth, it seemed to be
frightened at the sight of the fair object against whom it was to be
launched, and tumbled back again. It’s no use: when a man is in love,
the more he loves, the more silent he becomes; at least it was so in
my case. And when I did manage, after much stammering and blushing, to
“pop the question,” the first word from the lady set me shivering; and
the conclusion of her remarks set me running from the house utterly
demoralized,—“I shall always be happy to see you as a <i>friend</i>, your
conversation is so agreeable.” Here was a damper, after six weeks of
unremitting though <i>silent</i> attention. But she likes me, I’m sure of
that. It is my silence which has frightened her. I only need a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111a" id="Page_111a">[Pg 111]</a></span>
more variety in my style of conversation to make myself agreeable to
her. I have an original idea; and I advise all bashful men to take
warning from my past experience, and profit by my future. I will
<i>borrow</i> language in which to speak my passion. There’s nothing very
original in borrowing, financially speaking; but to borrow another
man’s ideas by which to make love, I call original. And, as luck would
have it, I have an excellent opportunity to test my new idea. Lounging
in the sanctum of my friend Quill, the editor of “The Postscript,” a
few days ago, he called my attention to an advertisement which had
just been presented for insertion. It ran thus: “Wanted, a reader,—a
gentleman who has studied poetic and dramatic compositions with a
view to delivery, who has a good voice, and who would be willing to
give one evening a week to the entertaining of an invalid. Address,
with references, ‘Stella,’ Postscript Office.” I recognized the
handwriting as that of the lady to whom I had been paying attentions,
the signature as the <i>nom de plume</i> under which she had written several
poetic contributions for the press; and I had no trouble in guessing
the meaning of the advertisement, knowing she has an invalid uncle.
“There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune.” I felt that it was high tide with me, and boldly
launched my canoe; answered the advertisement under the assumed name
of “Festus,” and waited for a reply. It came: “Stella is satisfied
with the references of Festus, and will give him an opportunity to
test his ability as a reader Tuesday evening next,”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
etc. You will naturally conclude that my heart bounded with rapture on
receiving this favorable answer. It did nothing of the sort: on the
contrary, the rebound almost took away my breath. I began to shiver and
shake, and felt inclined to retreat. But “love conquers all things.”
I determined to persevere; and here I am, by appointment, to test the
practicability of my original idea. The lady is a fine reader. I am
well acquainted with her favorite authors; and, if I can but interest
her in this novel suit, may at least pass a pleasant evening if I am
<i>not</i> unspeakably happy. I was told to wait for Stella. (<i>Takes a book
from table, and sits</i> <span class="smcap">l.</span> <i>of table, with his
back to</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span>) Shakspeare, ah! Let me draw a
little courage from the perusal of this. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Stella</span>,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112a" id="Page_112a">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> My maid said Festus was in this room. Ah! there he is, deep
in a book: that’s so like these literary gentry! No sooner are their
roving eyes fastened on a book than it is seized with the avidity with
which a starving man grasps a loaf of bread. He seems happy: I will
not disturb him. (<i>Sits on tête-à-tête.</i>) What a strange idea! Here
am I to pass the evening listening to the voice of one whom I never
saw before. This is one of my uncle’s whims: he fears I am working too
hard to entertain him with readings from his favorite authors, and so
determines to employ a reader to relieve me. Dear uncle, with all his
pain and suffering he has a sharp eye: he notices my want of spirit,
and thinks it is caused by weariness. He little knows that the true
cause is that stupid lover of mine, who sat here evening after evening
as dumb as an oyster, until, out of spite, I started him off. What
could have ailed the man? Nothing could he say but “Yes, ma’am,” “No,
ma’am,” “Fine evening,” “Good-night.” I never was so plagued in all my
life, for I should have liked the fellow if he had only tried to make
himself agreeable; but he was as silent and stupid as—Festus here.
(<span class="smcap">Festus</span> <i>rises, gesticulating with his hand,
his eyes fastened on the book</i>.) What can the man be about?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> (<i>Reading.</i>) “Is this a dagger which I see before me? the
handle towards my hand? Come, let me clutch thee! I have thee not, and
yet I see”—(<i>Turns and sees</i> <span class="smcap">Stella</span>. <i>Drops book,
and runs behind chair very confused.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Good gracious! you here again?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> I beg your pardon. You are—I am—</p>

<p>Stella. I thought, sir, I was to have no more of your <i>agreeable</i>
society.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> I beg your pardon, madam: you seem to be in error. I am
Festus,—Festus.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> You Festus?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh, yes: I’m Festus! I came here by appointment.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> What do you mean, sir? I expected a gentleman here to read.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Exactly! Pray, are you the invalid?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Sir, you are insulting! You will be kind enough to leave this
room at once. I thought the last time you were here—</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Excuse me for interrupting; but you evidently mistake me for
some other person. I never was in this house before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113a" id="Page_113a">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Is the man crazy? Do you mean to say you did not make a
proposal of marriage to me in this very room a week ago?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Madam, you surprise me. To the best of my knowledge and
belief, I never saw you before.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Was there ever such assurance? Is not your name—</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Festus; and yours Stella. Am I not right?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Sir, this is very provoking; but, if you are Festus, what is
your object in calling here?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> To entertain you.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> To entertain me! With what, pray? Sitting on the edge of a
chair, and twirling your thumbs?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>)&emsp;That’s a hard hit.&emsp;(<i>Aloud.</i>)&emsp;With readings,
if you please.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Readings! Pray, what do you read? Ovid’s “Art of Love”?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Madam, I answered your advertisement, being desirous of
securing the situation of reader to an invalid.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> You won’t suit.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> You haven’t heard me.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> No, but I’ve seen you; and your silence cannot be excelled by
your reading.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Will you hear me read?</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> No: you will not suit.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Very well: then I <i>claim</i> the trial. Remember your
promise,—“Stella is satisfied with the references of ‘Festus,’ and
will give him an opportunity to test his ability as a reader Tuesday
evening,” etc.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Oh, very well! If you insist upon making yourself ridiculous,
proceed. (<i>Sits in chair,</i> <span class="smcap">r.</span> <i>of table, and
turns her back on</i> <span class="smcap">Festus</span>.)</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> But will you not listen to me? I cannot read to you while you
sit in that position.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> I told you I did not wish to hear you read: you insist.
Proceed: I am not interested.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh, very well! My first selection shall be from the writings
of one well known to fame,—a lady whose compositions have electrified
the world; whose poetic effusions have lulled to sleep the cross and
peevish infant, stilled the noisy nursery, and exerted an influence
upon mankind of great and lasting power; one whose works are memorable
for their antiquity,—the gift of genius to the budding

<p><i>Stella.</i> (<i>Starting up.</i>)&emsp;Mother Goose!</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Yes: are you acquainted with the lady?</p>

the whole evening?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Oh, no! I think I can get through the book in about an hour.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Sir, you have forced yourself here, an unwelcome visitor: you
insist upon my hearing such nonsense as Mother-Goose melodies for an
hour. Do you call that gentlemanly?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Madam, you advertised for a reader. I have applied, with your
permission, for the situation. Under the circumstances, I naturally
expected to have your attention during the reading of such selections
as I should offer; instead of which, you turn your back upon me, and
very coolly bid me proceed. Do <i>you</i> call that ladylike?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115a" id="Page_115a">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Frankly, no. You have asked the trial: you shall have it.
For an hour I will hear you; and, though I strongly suspect the situation
of reader is not the object of your visit, you shall have no reason to
complain of my inattention. Is that satisfactory?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Pray go a step farther. You are said to have fine
elocutionary powers. May I not hope to have the pleasure of hearing
your voice? Grant me your assistance, and my hour’s trial may perhaps
be made agreeable to both.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Oh! not quite certain of your ability, Mr. Festus?</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Not in the presence of so fine a reader.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> A compliment! Well, I agree.</p>

<p><i>Festus.</i> Let me hear you read: that will give me courage to make the
attempt myself.</p>

<p><i>Stella.</i> Oh, very well! Remembering your partiality for juvenile
literature, you will pardon me if I read a very short but sweet poem.

<p><i>Stella.</i> That is very amusing; but, Mr. Festus, if this is the extent
of your elocutionary acquirements—</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
